It’s my special place, and I don’t wanna tell anyone about it. I always come here when I want to be alone.</p><p>But one day, there was someone else here, which had never happened before. It was an older girl reading a book in the shade—I remember she looked kinda sad. I could tell right away she was a Noble: Her clothes were beautiful… And she was the prettiest person I’d ever seen in my life! After a second, she saw me staring and gave me a weird smile.</p><p>“You want this book?” She asked me.</p><p>“I’m done with it.”</p><p>I took it from her, but I was nervous the whole time; I’d never actually talked to a Noble before!</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The book she gave me was a collection of children’s stories. It had tons of pretty pictures, and I’ve read it every single day since. Each story was about a princess who fell in love with a prince. It was so different from my own life, and it helped me forget how sad everything was for me, if just for a little while.</p><p>But the book was also weird: All the pictures of the princesses had been scratched over with black ink… And the last page of every story was torn out. While I was certain all the princesses would live happily ever after… I also wanted to know how the stories ended, which meant I needed to find the Noble girl.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Eventually, I decided to go into town and look for her. It’s not just that I wanted to know how the stories ended—I also wanted to see her again. Because even though I knew we were worlds apart, I still thought I might be able to be her friend.</p><p>There was a lively wedding taking place in town that day. And while the pretty bride in her white dress was surrounded by crowds of people, she looked so very lonely. I recognized the bride right away. It was the Noble girl. Part of me wanted to run up and congratulate her, but I hesitated. Because even though everyone around her was smiling big, she looked like… she was screaming on the inside.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>I had a dream. In it, the Noble girl in her white dress was trying to tell me something. “Don’t lose ⬜⬜ ⬜⬜,” she said. As she talked, red started to spread out from her chest, staining her nice white dress. The color was far too sad for the nice Noble girl, and I woke up from the dream in a panic.</p><p>I went back to playing alone in the ruins. But one day, I noticed something stuck between a couple of stones. It was one of the missing story endings. It showed the prince and princess at their happy wedding. Later, I started hearing rumors in town:</p><p>But I know they’re not talking about the nice Noble girl, because all princesses get to live happily ever after.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Months before she was cast down to the lowest class</p><p>“Is this dress too garish?” My sister drew up her shoulders as she spoke, grasping the hem of her beautiful white dress. It was generously decorated in layer upon layer of delicate lace, with small diamonds sparkling here and there. I let out a small sigh as I stared at her. “You look lovely, my sister. And well you should, for today is certain to be the finest day of your life.”</p><p>My sister nodded, satisfied, and turned this way and that to better admire her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>We were twins, both princesses in the land we called home. Though we shared a visage, my sister was bright, sociable, smart, and popular. She was the very image of perfection. Whereas I was shy, dull, not at all clever, I didn’t have many friends… I was wholly unremarkable. This day, my sister was setting off on a journey to be wed to a foreign prince. It would be a grand ceremony on a scale I had never seen. Our country and the prince’s had long been at war, you see, but this wedding would unite our families and finally bring an end to the seemingly eternal conflict. It had all been set in motion by our mother—the queen.</p><p>The day was clear, and a warm sun sat high in the sky. Before stepping into the jewel-studded carriage, my sister turned to take a final look at the castle where she was born and raised.</p><p>“I will birth a son and raise the next king, Mother,” she said with pride.</p><p>“So wait and stay safe until then.”</p><p>With these words, she entered her carriage. Moments later, the carriage set off with great pomp. It would be several days before she crossed the border, so she settled in for a long ride. It sparkled in the sunlight, as though lighting the path ahead.</p><p>What a perfect beauty! What a perfect wedding! What a perfect prince!</p><p>I was so proud of my sister; seemingly nothing was beyond her reach, and she had accomplished everything she ever set out to do in life. I knew her future would be bright, with nothing but great things waiting for her. That’s how her life always was, after all. I waved and waved until the carriage vanished from view.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The girl slowly opens her eyes. Then closes them. She had been dreaming again. In her dream, she was a princess. She is disappointed that sleep has fled; she wanted to see more. For even though she wasn’t the lead princess in this particular dream, it was still much nicer than her usual nightmares. Defeated, she opens her eyes, gazes for a moment at the foul, grime-covered ceiling above, and rises from her shabby bed. Today, she will study hard, help however she can, and spend another day being a very good girl.</p><p>“Good morning, Mommy. Do you want to hear about my dream?”</p><p>She greets her mother cheerfully, as she does every day. The older woman does not even look up; she just continues peeling potatoes.</p><p>“Dreams are nonsense, girl, and you’ve no time for such foolery. Now eat your breakfast and get to school.”</p><p>On the table is a bowl of thin gruel and a heel of bread. The girl sits on a rickety chair and pulls the food close. The bread is hard enough to shatter teeth. But it’s all Commoners like them can afford, so she’s quite used to it.</p><p>“Last night’s dream was special, Mommy. I was a princess!”</p><p>Her mother sets a potato down and turns to stare at her daughter. Her eyes seem to bore holes in her.</p><p>“I told you to knock off that fool talk. You’re a Commoner, not a Noble—and you never will be.”</p><p>The girl is well aware of this.</p><p>Even the youngest child knowns of the country’s strict class system. Here, the disparity between Nobles and Commoners is great indeed. The Commoners have long been discontent with their lot in life, and the Nobles worry increasingly about social unrest. But the girl had no wish to argue politics—she simply wanted to make conversation with her mother. Stung, she drops her eyes and quickly finishes her breakfast.</p><p>“I’m going now, Mommy.”</p><p>The girl hurriedly gets dressed, gathers her things, and leaves the house for school. Winter. A most rainy season. Though the rain has stopped, puddles still dot the road. She stands at one and looks at her face reflected in the water. She does not look like her mother. Nor does she look at all like her father. She senses she is not much loved by either. And she believes her face to be the reason. Suddenly angry, she stamps on the face in the puddle and rushes off to school. She is determined to study hard and win her parents’ praise.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The roses were finally blooming. From my window, I saw the bright red flowers stretching out as far as the eye could see. The buds had been firmly shut for so long, but warm weather had finally come yesterday to loosen winter’s icy hold. But as magnificent as the flower garden was, I had grown so very weary of looking at it. I had been staring at it since the day I arrived in this country…. Since the day they locked me in this room. To pass the time, I started counting the roses. When I reached the 48th rose, I spotted the prince walking alongside his young and beautiful princess.</p><p>I knew the princess well. She was my twin, after all. A group of Nobles followed them, chattering merrily away. The castle, a fun and lively place for most inhabitants, hosted a tea party in the garden at this time every week. Delighted peels of laughter soon intermingled with the clinking of porcelain. I quietly slipped out of view and listened in.</p><p>“You have been beaming with happiness every day since the wedding, Your Highness.”</p><p>“People all across the land speak of the princess’s beauty!”</p><p>It was true: The marriage of a prince from the west and my sister from the east was on the lips of people in both countries. Of greatest concern was when she might bear him a child.</p><p>That was the reason I am here; the reason I was summoned to this place soon after the wedding was complete. Because I…I am to birth the prince’s child in place of my sister.</p><p>“Oh, I can hardly wait! Will it be a prince or princess?”</p><p>“No matter what, I’m certain it will be adorable.”</p><p>“I’ve heard His Majesty the King has already prepared several midwives for the happy day.”</p><p>It didn’t take long for the prince and his court to realize his new bride was barren. So I was smuggled into the country in the dead of night. No one could be allowed to know of my existence. Of course, I would do anything for my sister.<br>Anything….<br> I just thought she might come see me at some point.</p><p>“The sun is beginning to set.”</p><p>“You should not be out and about in the cold, Princess. Let us return to the castle at once.”</p><p>As the crimson glow of dusk began to fill the room, the lively voices grew distant. It seemed the party had ended. I moved from the window and began preparing myself for the prince’s arrival—for though my sister had not seen fit to visit, he arrived every night like clockwork. And there, in that darkening room, I waited.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The loud ringing of a bell pulls the girl back to reality. She had been unable to concentrate during class; she kept thinking about last night’s dream. The sun sits high in the winter sky, its rays peeking through gaps in the clouds to brighten the classroom. It was the continuation of her previous dream, the one where the princess rode off in a carriage. The girl is yet young, and while she does not understand her dream completely, she knows that Nobles sometimes have to do what their parents say and live a life not wholly their own. In this way, she finds being a Commoner a relief. And once she is grown up, she hopes to live a life of even greater freedom.</p><p>The school she attends is specifically for Commoners. Everyone, from the highest-ranking teacher to the lowliest student, is still a Commoner at the end of the day. The classroom grows lively as some of the more impatient children begin to gather up their textbooks.</p><p>“That’s all for today,” says the teacher.</p><p>“Oh, but before I forget, I have the results from last week’s test.”</p><p>The teacher looks directly at the girl and smiles.</p><p>“Your classmate here had top marks yet again. I hope you all learn from her and study hard!”</p><p>The girl happily hugs her textbook to her chest at the news. She runs the whole way home to tell her mother.</p><p>“Mommy, Mommy! Guess what!? I got first on the test again!” Her mother is standing in the living room with her back to her, holding a large mug in her hands. She slowly turns around at her daughter’s voice.</p><p>“If I study lots, do you think I could become a doctor or a lawyer?”</p><p>Her mother finishes off the contents of the mug—which is clearly some sort of alcohol—and slams it down on the table. The scent of her breath fills the room like a cloud.</p><p>“Are you mad, girl?” she says loudly.</p><p>“We’ve not the money to let you study forever.”</p><p>“Now clear your head of these fool dreams and get to the laundry!”</p><p>Dejected, the girl leaves to fetch the hamper. For a brief moment, a long-buried thought rises up in the girl’s chest:<br>What if she’s not my mother? We look nothing alike, after all.<br> She shakes the thought away.<br>No. I love her. Even if we aren’t related by blood…<br> But the poor girl’s desire for love has no outlet, so it simply continues to swell painfully in her chest.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Winter had arrived; the flower garden was cold and barren. But inside a heated room, a newborn baby made its first cry.</p><p>“Oh dear. A girl.”</p><p>The midwife holding the baby made no attempt to hide her disappointment; nor did the king and prince, who were both leaning against a nearby wall. With sweat running down my body, I instinctively reached out to hold the new life I created. But they do not even grant me that kindness.</p><p>“A shame,” said the king.</p><p>“Very well. Dispose of her at once.”</p><p>He and his son left the room without another word. But the princess—my twin sister—remained.</p><p>“You there,” she said to the midwife.</p><p>“You are dismissed.”</p><p>The woman froze in place for a moment. Then she set the baby down, bowed, and scuttled out of the room along with the rest of the women who attended the birth. The last time my sister and I were alone was a year ago—when I praised her exquisite wedding dress. But I lay still and quiet in my bed, unsure if I should view this as a heartfelt reunion or begin begging for mercy.</p><p>“This is your fault, you know? What I’m about to do? If you’d just given birth to a son, it wouldn’t have come to this.”</p><p>With that, my sister produced a small knife from her pocket…</p><p>…………</p><p>Cradling my newborn daughter, I ran from the castle with only the clothes on my back.</p><p>My mind was chaos.</p><p>They were going to kill my daughter. My own sister was going to kill her! Why!? Why, why, why!?</p><p>I had no answer to this question. But then again, I’d never been especially bright. I came to this wretched country for my sister’s sake. I bore a child for my sister’s sake. All for her sake. All for her sake all for her sake all for her sake…</p><p>I had nowhere to go. A traveling merchant kindly allowed me to ride on his cart, and after a night of hard travel, I woke up in a small border town. On the harsh midwinter morning, a mixture of snow and sleet rained down without mercy or pause. Having pushed my body to its limits right after giving birth, I was stricken with a high fever and fuzzy thoughts. But my sweet daughter was warm and dry in a thick blanket, and as I held her to me, my troubles seemed to dissipate. She was asleep. She looked just like an angel.</p><p>“Hey, there’s someone on the ground over here!” I heard footsteps splash in a puddle near my ear, and the voice of a young woman echo above my head.</p><p>“Heavens, she’s got a baby…” Another voice called out—a man this time.</p><p>“Aye, I fear this girl’s done for.”</p><p>“Poor thing. To think she’ll be leaving this child behind…”</p><p>They almost seemed to be talking about someone else. Apparently I collapsed, though I did not remember it. I could hear my daughter crying nearby. Despite how hard the sleet was coming down, I could do nothing for her; I did not even have the strength to stand. Thankfully, someone had found us. With great effort, I turned my head and looked at the couple. Please…raise her as your own. Make her happy. The words I had intended to say never made it from my mouth. The chill of the sleet pounding my body slowly faded away, the sound growing distant…distant…distant… And finally, my conscious faded….Forever.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The girl briskly walks through a bone-chilling cold. Her mother had sent her out to fetch their bread ration. It’s a rainy winter day—just like the one from her dream. She is wearing every layer she owns, but the sudden downpour cuts through her garments like a knife. As she listens to the never-ending torrent, she thinks back on the sight she dreamed of that morning. Now that I think about it…<br>It’s funny how the couple that found “me” on the ground looked a lot like Mommy and Daddy…</p><p>“Mommy! I’m home!”</p><p>The girl, her pigtails dripping, produces three loaves of bread from the inside of her coat and grins happily. The bread is a bit damp, but dry compared to the girl. Her mother, who was warming herself at the hearth, takes the loaves with a bit of a guilty look.</p><p>“Thank you, girl. Now hurry up and get changed! You’re dripping water all over the house.”<br>As the girl slowly peels off her clothes, she only thinks of one thing: I hope that made Mommy happy…</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>“How long are you planning to sleep, child!? Get up already!” The woman throws the bedroom door open. Her daughter, who usually wakes up on her own, has slept late into the morning today. She stomps over to her tiny bed.</p><p>“Come now, get up. I need you to fetch the bread again.”</p><p>The woman throws back the blanket on the bed to reveal the girl lying there languidly, her face red.</p><p>“M-Mommy… I think I’m sick…” croaks the girl.</p><p>“I’m cold and hot all at once…and I c-can’t move…”</p><p>Her mother places a hand on her forehead. She is burning up. The woman immediately recalls how she sent her out in the sleet the previous day to fetch their food. Then she emits a small sigh and pulls the blanket back in place.</p><p>“Well then, never mind the bread. You just rest.”</p><p>“Th-thank you, Mommy…”</p><p>As the woman gets up and makes to leave, the girl calls out to her weakly.</p><p>“Well?” says the woman.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I wanna slurpy apple,” replies the girl in a pitiful voice.</p><p>“Is that okay?”</p><p>The woman stares at the child in the blanket. She never asks for things, she thinks. Without a word, the woman closes the door behind her. And to request slurpy apple—a grated fruit treat she used to make her when she was small—is even stranger.</p><p>She walks into the living room to find her husband peeling off his coat, still damp from his turn on the watch.</p><p>“Raining again,” he says.</p><p>“Awful stuff.”</p><p>The woman places a bowl of warm soup on the table. Her husband peers down at it, clearly disappointed, but she chooses to overlook this. With a small sigh, he digs into his meager meal. But after a few moments, he suddenly puts the spoon down.</p><p>“Hey, how’s the kid?”</p><p>“Feverish. I’m letting her rest today.”</p><p>“I swear, that child is next to useless.”</p><p>The woman sits opposite her husband and plucks an apple off the table.</p><p>“She came home soaked after her errands yesterday—probably what made her ill.”</p><p>She picks up a small knife and begins peeling the fruit.</p><p>“You sent her out in that?” says her husband.</p><p>“Hells, the other guards won’t even leave the barracks when it’s coming down so.”</p><p>The woman stops peeling and glares at her husband.</p><p>“Oh, so now I’m a magician who knows exactly when the rain is going to start and stop?”</p><p>Her husband wisely turns his attention back to his soup. The woman returns to her peeling.</p><p>“You know, she’s not a bad kid,” he says finally.</p><p>“You don’t have to be so cold to her.”</p><p>“Honestly, sometimes I feel like she’s…wasted on us.”</p><p>The peeled apple skin curls into a neat pile on the table.</p><p>“You’re right there,” she replies.</p><p>“Why, if she had our genes, she’d grow up to be a frightful beast just like us!”</p><p>The man looks down at his bowl again; silence was always his retreat when things weren’t going his way. The woman picks up the empty soup bowl, takes it to the kitchen, and returns with a grater. She slides the apple against it, creating a harsh rasp.</p><p>“You know I hate it when she rubs our differences in my face.”</p><p>The sound of the apple on the grater hangs heavy in the air.</p><p>“It’s almost her birthday,” says the husband. He stares out the window as he talks.</p><p>The rain is coming down harder, turning into sleet.</p><p>“I mean, not like we know exactly when she was born…”</p><p>“But we found her on a cold, rainy day much like this one.”</p><p>The grating slows as the apple is worn down to nothing.</p><p>“She’s starting to look like her mother,” says the woman after a long pause.</p><p>“Won’t be long until she realizes she don’t look like us at all.”</p><p>“Aye, that woman was a great beauty indeed.”</p><p>The woman glares at her husband again, but says nothing. Instead, she gets up and tosses the apple core into the sink. With the bowl of grated apple in hand, she returns to the girl’s room.</p><p>Her face is still red, but she is at least sleeping.<br>Pity this poor thing ending up with us when she could have lived a good, free life as a Noble.<br> The woman reaches out to touch the girl’s cheek, but stops. Instead, she places the bowl on the nightstand and leaves. The girl is beginning to realize she is not their true daughter. And yet, she does all she can to earn their love. But her looks aren’t the only thing that set her apart: there is also her purity, her honesty, and her bravery. The beauty of her very spirit tells the couple how different she is…. Perhaps they made a mistake taking her in that day. The apple sitting beside the girl begins to brown. It grows darker still. Uglier. Horrid. But the girl notices nothing in her deep, deep sleep.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>It is a terrible, terrible monster. His body is jet-black armor, and he has twisted insect wings on his back.</p><p>And sometimes, the monster comes to this world and EATS people.</p><p>This is why we must all unite and fight him whenever he appears.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>………………</p><p>As a light spring breeze dances through the plaza, four young girls sit around an open picturebook. The image on the page displays an eyeless, ebon monster. It resembles a large insect, yet is somehow uncannily human. The sight makes the hair of all who see it stand on end.</p><p>The children take one glance at the picture and begin to scream with both terror and delight.</p><p>The tale of the monster has been passed down in this country for an age.</p><p>The picturebook which now entertains the four children is based upon it.</p><p>The girls enjoy themselves regardless—huddling close, laughing, scaring one another.</p><p>But then comes the sound of light footsteps—thin soles on flagstone.</p><p>The four girls look up from the book, their frigid gazes alighting on the source of the sound. It is another girl, her hair tied back in pigtails. Her head hangs low. On her neck and wrists are manacles and a collar, a symbol of her status as a Goat Person.</p><p>Goat People<br>.</p><p>That is the name for this nation’s lowest class of person. The Goat girl attempts to hurry past the other children, trying not to look at them as she does. And then…</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>The leader of the four gently calls out to the Goat girl.</p><p>The lone girl’s face brightens.</p><p>The leader’s personality can be a bit overbearing, but she is a good student, and her greeting sounds both pleasant and sincere.</p><p>The Goat girl is delighted.</p><p>But as she is about to return the greeting, she falls forward.</p><p>Her words are swallowed by cobblestone and shame.</p><p>The leader has tripped her.</p><p>She looks at the Goat girl and laughs, and her friends soon join in.</p><p>Goat People are the lowest of the low; they are meant to be abused without reason or cause. This idea has diffused itself among the young children.</p><p>The leader then speaks: “We are honored to be in the presence of a Goat Person this day, girls! Now…shall we play Monster?”</p><p>Play Monster.</p><p>In this game, one child takes on the role of the monster while the others pursue them. And, of course, the Goat girl is to take on the role of monster.</p><p>The other children throw the book at the lowly girl’s feet.</p><p>The open page shows the dark monster standing by himself.</p><p>He is hated. Just as she is. And so the girl begins to run. She runs and she runs and she runs—for she knows<br>terrible<br> things will happen if she is caught.</p><p>As she flees for her life, she eventually comes to a desolate and aging ruin. It is her precious, secret spot for play. Though it is typically worn and dirty, beautiful flowers bloom here at this time of year. After she ensures the other girls have not followed, she crouches down among the blossoms and breathes a sigh of relief. When her ragged breath finally calms, she lifts her head…</p><p>Only to be greeted by a surprising sight. The man-eating monster stands before her with his jet-black body and hideous insect wings. He waits silently among the colorful blooms.</p><p>“Are you…Mister Monster?” asks the girl. Her voice is a whisper’s memory. He remains silent. Suddenly, a thought comes to her:</p><p>We are the same.</p><p>The dark creature is her twin in all but name.</p><p>“Are you lonely, Mister Monster?”</p><p>She approaches him slowly. Flowers dance in the wind around her feet. “I think you are.”<br>Poor Mister Monster. Everyone hates you just like they hate me.<br> She gently places her hand on the silent monster. Strangely enough, she feels no fear. What she sees in front of her is not some terrible brute, but a creature who is alone no matter where he goes. A creature just like her. This is why she is not afraid.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>The Goat girl’s light footsteps echo across the plaza. She makes her way for the blossom-covered ruin. Her secret spot where the monster waits.</p><p>“Hey. You.”</p><p>A voice suddenly stops her in her tracks. She turns to find the four girls who are always playing in the plaza. The leader has called to her. “You haven’t been coming by lately. We miss you! Why don’t you play Monster with us today?” A cruel smile twists the corner of the girl’s mouth as she speaks. They want to play Monster with the Goat girl so they have an excuse to cause her pain.</p><p>The Goat girl’s eyes drop to the ground. She takes a quiet step backwards. “I’m sorry,” is all she says before dashing away.</p><p>The children exchange bewildered glances. The leader’s expression twists further. Her mind reels.<br>That<br>Goat<br> disobeyed me! ME!</p><p>Also, she’s been in a strangely good mood lately.</p><p>It makes me sick.</p><p>No Goat Person should ever smile like that.</p><p>The leader’s eyes bore into the girl’s back as she runs.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Red flower. Blue flower. White flower.</p><p>The girl’s voice echoes throughout the ruin, which overflows with colorful flowers. She moves around the aberrant monster, dancing ballet on a beat of three. Only recently did girl and monster meet, yet already they are in perfect sync. It’s as if they are partners—as if they have been dancing together for the whole of their lives.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>The girl dances.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Flowers nod.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Wind blows. Petals flutter this way and that in the air.</p><p>Suddenly, the girl gasps in wonder, her dance coming to a halt. Both she and the monster look to the sky. They see petals soaring though the blue.</p><p>“Where do you think the flowers are going, Mister Monster?”</p><p>The monster does not reply. He is ever silent, never speaking. But the girl feels she hears his answer regardless. His voice is gruff, yet kind. Time spent alone with the monster is unbelievably precious to the girl. As a Goat Person, all she has ever known is abuse. But this lonely monster makes no attempt to wound the girl. This is why she hides away in the ruin.</p><p>It is so she does not have to face a painful reality. Yet while this is all happening…</p><p>A lone figure hides among the crumbling walls, quietly watching the girl. It is the leader of the children who play in the plaza. She thought the Goat girl’s pleasant mood strange, and so followed her in secret. And when she came to the ruin, she beheld a most confusing sight. The Goat girl was dancing by herself. Laughing by herself.</p><p>Mister Monster!<br>The leader watches in silence as the girl turns to empty space and calls to the monster over and over again.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The Goat girl’s bindings garner cold stares as she walks through town. But she does not care. For no matter what terrible things might happen, she has the companionship of a very kind monster. Yet another day finds her racing down the street for the ruin where the monster waits. Suddenly, she comes to a halt.</p><p>Smoke tickles her nostrils. Her face clouds. Something is on fire.</p><p>Knowing this bodes ill, she makes for the ruin as fast as she can.</p><p>I hope Mister Monster is okay<br>, she thinks to herself.</p><p>She soon arrives at the ruin. It is ablaze. Flames billow from a great pile of discarded junk. Broken chairs. Shattered clocks. The flames lick at the flowers, threatening to turn everything to ash. The ruin was meant to be a secret place for herself and the monster, and now it is lost.</p><p>“Mister Monster, no!” cries the girl. She sounds as though she could start sobbing at any moment. The monster is sitting listlessly in the middle of the ruin.<br>He’s going to die.</p><p>But as she leaps into the flames to save him…</p><p>“She’s here! The Goat is here!”</p><p>High-pitched laughter scratches the girl’s ears. She turns in the direction of the voice. The four girls from the plaza are waiting for her. Their leader takes a step forward, a lopsided smile on her face. In her hand she holds a stick, the tip smoldering with flame. She realizes these four are the ones who set the ruin to burn—the ones who stole her special place.</p><p>A black snake worms its way into her heart. She has never felt such an emotion before.</p><p>“You’re awful…” she mutters fiercely. “How<br>dare<br> you do this to Mister Monster!”</p><p>“Mister Monster?” The children exchange glances and begin to snicker amongst themselves. A moment later, the leader speaks.</p><p>“Your ‘Mister Monster’ doesn’t exist, Goat. He’s just a thing from a picturebook.” The leader had glimpsed the girl’s secret. She saw her playing by herself. She saw her speak to empty air.</p><p>“You poor thing. You must have been so<br>lonely<br>!”</p><p>Her words tear at the Goat girl like glass.</p><p>“Don’t you get it? You made the monster up!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl remains quiet, her eyes glistening under tears.</p><p>But then…</p><p>“No. He’s here. I know he’s here.”</p><p>She refuses to acknowledge it—she<br>cannot<br>. Doing so would mean her only friend does not exist.</p><p>“Are you okay, Mister Monster? You must be in so much pain.”</p><p>With teetering steps, she enters the flames. She finds herself entering an empty space. Flames lick at her legs. Her arms. But she pays them no mind. Because she can<br>see<br>. She sees the monster sitting amidst the fire, his body covered in burns. He is her precious friend.</p><p>Her hand brushes empty air. But to her, it is the monster’s cheek. She crouches down to pluck a single burning flower at the monster’s feet. Hot fire chars her palm. The pain is an idle thing. Distant. For she knows the monster suffers far more than she.</p><p>This is all<br>their<br> fault.<br>Her gaze rests on the burning flower.<br>Dancing flames reflect in dull eyes.</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The sun sets.</p><p>Darkness falls over the area. The once-dancing flames, now clinging to life, cast an eerie light on the ruin.</p><p>The children who started this fire are long gone, returned home to warmth and family. They had amassed the junk and lit the spark.</p><p>The ruin—the secret spot for the girl and the monster—is now little more than a wreck.</p><p>The girl stands silent. Alone. She stares at the monster, who is now a shriveled thing covered head to foot in burns.<br>Your “Mister Monster” doesn’t exist.<br> The leader claimed the girl’s monster was merely a vision. But the girl never had any intention of acknowledging that truth. Her monster is here. He is<br>right<br> here. Yet the children filled the ruin with garbage and set it ablaze all the same. They hurt her monster.<br>Hurt<br> him.</p><p>I will not let them get away with this.</p><p>A new emotion, dark and heavy, encroaches on her heart. She picks up a piece of kindling and sets fire to the tip, creating a torch. Then she begins to walk. Her steps are unsteady, as though possessed by some entity. She arrives at a beautiful house, a dwelling that resembles the magnificent homes one might see in picturebooks. It belongs to the leader of the children.</p><p>The girl lifts the torch. Her mind whirls as she stares into the flame. The leader of the children set fire to her ruin. She burned her monster. Which means… Which means…</p><p>Which means she can destroy her home. She can destroy what the other holds most dear.</p><p>Burn it all.</p><p>With darkness urging her on, she raises the torch high above her head and thrusts it forward. Fire crackles. Sparks fly. Before her, something begins to burn.</p><p>…It is the monster.</p><p>The torch never reaches the leader’s house. Instead…</p><p>The monster has leapt in front of her, letting the flames strike him. Almost as though he is trying to stop her.</p><p>“Mister…Monster?”</p><p>The monster falls face-first onto the ground, his burning body writhing in pain.</p><p>“MISTER MONSTER!”</p><p>She rushes to him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Mister Monster! This is my fault! This is all my fault!”</p><p>All she can do is weep. She repeats her apology as she clings to the monster’s blazing body. But then she realizes something…</p><p>The blaze enveloping him holds no heat. Because the monster is nothing more than a figment of her imagination. Somewhere deep inside, she had known this—yet acknowledging it was a weight too heavy to bear. Because the kind monster had always been by her side. And yet…she hurt him. The monster’s hand trembles and gently brushes her cheek. It is incorporeal. Cold. Yet she imagines warmth anyway.</p><p>He’s so warm…</p><p>It is a strange warmth, one that makes her feel the darkness which had overcome her heart is beginning to fade. The monster’s body quietly burns in the gloaming. It twinkles. It shines. Finally, it turns to ash and begins the long ascent into the sky.</p><p>“Goodbye, Mister Monster.”</p><p>I had so much fun.</p><p>I had fun dancing with you.</p><p>I…fun watching flowers…in the wind.</p><p>I…fun…you silently…my side…</p><p>And…</p><p>And…</p><p>The girl realizes something. As the darkness that had encroached on her heart fades away, so too do her memories of the monster. The monster has taken all of her twisted feelings with him.</p><p>“Thank you, Mister Monster.”</p><p>Her memories dim, then fade. Soon the girl does not understand why she is crying at all. Yet she continues to repeat herself.<br>Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> She does not fall silent until the final speck of ash has vanished into the heavens.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>……………………</p><p>The junk sits in a pile in the ruin. The beautiful spring blooms are gone. She is sad her secret place was laid to waste like this, but she is a Goat Person. It is to be expected. She repeats this to herself as she begins cleaning up the junk. “There we go,” she says as she lifts a broken clock. Suddenly she stops. Her heart catches in her chest. Beneath it, she finds a small flower still in bloom. The rest are blackened ash, yet this one alone remains. It shines brilliantly in the dark. A strange feeling suddenly bubbles up in the girl’s heart.</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I don’t know who you are…</p><p>But I miss you.</p><p>We’ll play together when I see you again. We’ll be even better friends.</p><p>Bewildered by the sudden well of emotion, the girl falls to her knees beside the flower. She begins to pray. She does not know the name of whom she misses, nor what they look like. But whoever they are, they have given her such<br>warmth<br>.</p><p>And so, she prays she might one day see them again.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Angelic Sacrifice<br>[<br>]</p><p>Mama: If I were to describe her in a word, it would be…angelic!

They were all bigger than her—and probably four or five years older—but she kept making snowballs and throwing them as best as she could. That’s when I realized she was the only one without gloves, and that her poor hands were bright red. Yet she still wore a beaming innocent smile on her face, which made my heart hurt.</p><p>“Fio’s so cheerful, even on a frigid day like this.”</p><p>My husband, having just woke, came over to stand beside me, watching our daughter amidst the large crowd of children.

After pulling it out of the closet, I unraveled it and began to knit a pair of gloves from the yarn, figuring the soft hues would look better on her than me, anyway.

I’m now researching magical pharmacology with my best friend—the slightly scatterbrained girl in glasses.</p><p>Everyone in our class approaches their research carefully. That’s because each month, the teachers look over our work and evaluate its merits. Knowing this, I dive into my studies with gusto.</p><p>I’m good at focusing on the tiny kinds of details others tend to miss. After a while, the others take notice of this talent, and I’m eventually chosen to be our class representative.</p><p>But while I usually try to do everything myself, my best friend is always reminding me to try and work with the others. So I decide to give it a shot—for her.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>At first, everyone in class seems to be enjoying themselves. But as the days go by, the others start to get more and more worn down.</p><p>I find this terrifically disappointing, because it’s not a lack of talent that holds them back—it’s a lack of effort. But they soon begin to drop out of class. One…after the other…after the other.</p><p>Eventually, the only students left are me and my best friend. I can tell this stresses her out, but the harder she works, the more nervous she gets—and her work soon begins to suffer.</p><p>One day, I turn to her and put a calming hand on her shoulder. “Hey,” I say. “You’re going to be all right. We’re almost through this, so just stay focused.”</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>I can tell the lack of other students disturbs my friend, but it doesn’t bother me at all. I’ve never needed outside sources for motivation, and I won’t ever give up on a task before seeing it through to the bitter end.</p><p>That’s not to say this is easy, because it’s not. It’s hard. A task of this size split between two people is<br> hard. But my friend and I put our heads down and keep going, and somehow we come to the moment of the final experiment.</p><p>It all comes down to this: The two of us have to pour separate compounds into our beaker at the same time. And if we’re off by so much as a drop, all of our work will have been for nothing.</p><p>The moment of truth. My hands are slick with sweat. Slowly,<br> slowly, we begin pouring our compounds. But then my friend makes a sound—a tiny, almost imperceptible gasp—and our potion immediately turns from a bright blue to a dark, muddy brown.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Later that night, I knock on my best friend’s door. And while I know she’s in there, she refuses to answer. “Hey,” I say finally. “Come on. We have to try again.”</p><p>“Why?” she responds in a trembling voice. “You’re so good and I just… I don’t understand any of this. You’d be better off without me.”</p><p>“You’re right,” I say bluntly. “But me being so good means that no matter how many times you blow it, I’ll be there to pick you up. Now let’s go.”</p><p>The door creaks open and my friend’s face appears. She wipes absently at tears with one hand and puts her glasses back on. Then, grasping her other hand, I drag her back to the lab.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Day I was Born Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>A while after the girl was enrolled in the school of magick</p><p>She was brought here as a child so long ago. Days. Months. Years. Who can even say anymore? The reliefs carved on the outer walls seem to deny all who would dare seek entry to this place.</p><p>The wooden door creaks ominously whenever it opens. Each time, she sees a corridor shimmering with sunlit beauty as all the colors of the rainbow filter in through stained glass.</p><p>This is the school of magick. It has always been thus, and thus will it always be.</p><p>With everyone at rest this holiday morning, the school lies quiet as a grave.</p><p>But one student is up and about. It is the wavy-haired girl, who has abandoned the possibility of sleep in order to sneak into the school kitchens. Once there, she sets her bag on a table and reaches up for a nearby shelf.</p><p>One by one, she begins pulling down utensils. She takes each item and carefully sets it next to a pile of ingredients and a recipe book. When this task is complete, she wipes a bit of sweat from her eyes and dons an apron. By their own kind of magick, the girl’s assembled ingredients eventually become a thin, flat disc of dough. She takes a heart-shaped cutter and begins to stamp out smaller pieces from it. Once ready, her cookies slide into a warm oven.</p><p>After a minute of waiting, a sweet, gentle scent drifts across the empty kitchen.</p><p>The girl kneels down and peers through the glass oven door, watching as her treats slowly turn a golden brown. “I hope you taste good,” she whispers.</p><p>The children at the school of magick all live together. With a sizeable roster of students, there are always a couple dozen sharing birth months in any given term. Next month is the wavy-haired girl’s turn, along with one of her friends from class. The wavy-haired girl is practicing making the gift she intends to give her, because she wants it to be perfect. She pulls a cookie from the oven and bites into an edge. Flavors dance on her tongue, as well as an almost indescribably subtle sweetness.</p><p>Her mouth bends into a smile.<br>These will work,<br> she thinks.<br>These are good.</p><p>Now she just needs to practice her wrapping skills. Still smiling, she tidies up the kitchen, picks up her cookies, and returns to the dorm. She places her bag on her desk and waits for the special gift-wrapping fabric she had ordered to arrive. She would use some of it to wrap her practice batch of cookies and give the entire thing to her best friend, the bespectacled girl who lives next door.</p><p>Suddenly, the soft sound of a bell echoes through the room.</p><p>My fabric!<br> Delighted, she flings the door wide…only to find her teacher standing there.</p><p>She looks her teacher in the eye and smiles calmly, hoping her expression does not betray the butterflies that suddenly race inside her stomach. “Yes?” she asks. “What is it?”</p><p>Excuses for her recent kitchen excursion race through her mind. With an indecipherable look, the teacher slowly reaches out and hands her an envelope.</p><p>She pauses, unable to process what is happening. Finally, she manages to speak.</p><p>“Is that…a letter?” There is a slight tinge in her voice. Relief, perhaps?</p><p>Regardless, her teacher does not notice. “Yes. A letter. Come find me once you’ve read it.”</p><p>As she takes it with a puzzled look, her teacher turns around and departs.</p><p>She closes the door and stares at her new prize. The crisp white envelope has been closed with a wax seal.<br>It’s so formal,<br> she wonders.<br>What could it be?</p><p>She withdraws an opener from a drawer and slips it under the wax seal.</p><p>When she pulls the letter free, she sees that it is from the hospital in her hometown.</p><p>…The hospital? But why?<br> She begins to read the words on the page, her eyes darting back and forth like moths before a flame. The writing is clinical. The message brief.</p><p>Her mother has been admitted. As she ruminates over this new information, she feels the tips of her fingers grow cold. What should her response be?<br>What would it be if she came from a normal family? The moment the thought enters her mind, she knows her reaction is wrong. Her mother is ill. Perhaps dying. Yet she does not lose composure.<br>She feels no sadness. No worry. She simply stands in place, reading the same scant words over and over and over again.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Day I was Born Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>After passing through the stonework city, the girl’s vision fills with green.</p><p>The air on her skin feels different somehow. Brisker. She is making her way back to her hometown.</p><p>A few days earlier, she went to her teacher and revealed the contents of the letter.</p><p>She told how her mother had taken ill.</p><p>And she explained that the hospital had asked her to come out so they could go over the issue in person.</p><p>After hearing this, her teacher granted permission for the journey.</p><p>As the scenery continues to change, the girl begins to recognize more and more of her old home.</p><p>A sense of nostalgia weighs heavy on her heart.</p><p>She had been nervous in the days leading up to her departure.</p><p>So much so that her teacher had given her some kind words as she departed: “Try not to worry. I’m certain everything will be all right. And I know your mother will be thrilled to see you.”</p><p>But her mother is the very thing casting the shadow on the girl’s heart. Not because she is sick.</p><p>Oh no. That is not it at all. It is because of what she did.</p><p>The girl does not think of the woman who birthed her as her mother. To tell the truth, she barely thinks of her at all. Because she also remembers something else her mother once told her:</p><p>“I wish you had never been born.”</p><p>For these reasons, the thought of returning home fills the girl with a quiet, gnawing dread.</p><p>The closer she gets to her destination, the heavier her legs grow.</p><p>The image of her mother—so successfully pushed down for so long—begins to take unwelcome root in her mind. And awful memories start roiling in the deepest crevices of her heart.</p><p>Despite the sunlight beaming down on her, the girl’s sweat is cold.</p><p>The straps of her damp leather bag are stained a dusky brown.</p><p>The hospital looms before her like a challenge. And her mother awaits inside.</p><p>Trees rustle in the breeze outside the hospital doors.</p><p>Bright orange fruit hangs heavy from thin branches.</p><p>The girl stares at it and recalls a time, long ago, when she came here with her mother.</p><p>This fruit was ripe then, too.</p><p>It caught my eye, so I reached out to grab one that had fallen to the ground.</p><p>But when my mother noticed, she smacked me in the hand with her cane.</p><p>I cried. No, I didn’t cry. I<br>sobbed<br>. And all my mother could do was glare at me.</p><p>A ghostly pain from that long-ago day flashes through the back of her hand, and she quickly shakes it off. She wraps her fingers around the doorknob and pulls it open.</p><p>An empty reception desk sits sadly in the lobby. Not knowing what else to do, she begins wandering the halls in search of her mother’s room.</p><p>But the rest of the building is as empty as the lobby.</p><p>The entire hospital stands cold and forgotten, almost as if it is ready to dry up and blow away in the breeze.</p><p>She walks from one hallway to the next, opening doors and peering around corners, but finds only solitude. All that moves in this place are the thin white curtains on the windows.</p><p>The girl begins to feel as though she has been left behind, and unease wells up inside her.</p><p>The afternoon is warm. Languid. Tranquil. If the breeze were to stop, there would be no way to tell that time was still passing.</p><p>She makes her way down a long corridor, counting numbers as she goes.</p><p>103, 104, 105, 106…107.</p><p>Her mother’s room—or at least the room where she is supposed to be.</p><p>The girl gently pushes a door that swings on silent hinges and peers into the room.</p><p>A lone woman sits upright in bed, facing away from her as she gazes out the window.</p><p>Her mother. Despite the grim news contained in the letter, her posture seems firm.</p><p>Though her figure seems to have diminished a bit since the girl had seen her last.</p><p>Or perhaps it is simply that she herself has grown.</p><p>Her imagination begins to whirl. She pictures what her mother will look like when she finally turns around. How she will sound. What she might say.</p><p>With her head hanging low, she braces herself for whatever is to come.</p><p>It’s all right,<br> she thinks.<br>There’s nothing to be afraid of. There’s nothing to be afraid of. There’s nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>But the girl knows she cannot stand in place forever. She slowly moves forward, sliding her feet across the floor in an attempt to hide their sound.</p><p>One step…….</p><p>And another…….</p><p>After another step, her mother starts to rotate her head.</p><p>Another step later and now she is facing her. It is nothing at all like the girl imagined.<br>Her mother’s face is calm. After a moment, a childlike expression of glee moves across her features and she begins to speak. “Oh, Grandma! I’m so happy you’re here!”</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Day I was Born Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Gentle sunlight fills the white room. Thin curtains dance on the wind. Alone, the girl and her mother face each other. The older woman’s expression is the pure joy of a child.</p><p>It is so,<br>so<br> different from the image the girl has carried heavy in her memory for all this time.</p><p>She wonders briefly if this is even her real mother, and the thought makes ice run in her veins.</p><p>The mother of her memory is stern. Cold. Unfeeling. The thought of a smile from such a woman is folly.</p><p>Even when the girl truly needed help, her mother would turn away and walk off without a word.</p><p>Never had she reached down to help her up. Not once. But now…</p><p>“I’m sorry,” says a sudden voice from behind the girl. She whirls around to find an elderly man clad in a crisp doctor’s coat. “I’m sorry I could not be here to meet you in person,” he continues.</p><p>“We’ve just been so very understaffed lately.”</p><p>“Oh, um, that’s all right,” manages the girl. Before she can say more, the doctor takes a breath and begins to explain her mother’s condition. Something had gone terribly wrong with the cognitive functions in her brain, causing her to collapse. She had been discovered in her home a few days prior. But by the time they found her, she was too far gone.</p><p>Despite the best treatment they could muster, her brain function had not recovered.</p><p>Her state of mind had reverted to that of her own childhood. The more the doctor tells her, the more the girl’s mind reels. He seems to sense her discomfort, but his profession demands a certain clinical nature, so he soldiers on. “It is perhaps a bit cruel to say this to a child, but I feel you have the right to know.” He takes a breath, then another.</p><p>“We do not know how much time your mother has left. And if it is possible…We would like you to stay with her until the end.”</p><p>He stops talking then and waits. After a pause the length of an age, the girl tells him she will need some time to think. He nods and leaves her alone with her thoughts.</p><p>And alone with her mother.</p><p>Origami stars and animals are taped to the walls. Balloons hang brightly in one corner.</p><p>Her mother’s room has been decorated like the play area of a child.</p><p>The girl stares at one of the stars.<br>Did my mother make this? Did she make all of these?</p><p>Behind her, her mother opens a desk drawer. After a bit of rustling, she pulls out a few sheets of origami paper. “Let’s make something!” she cries happily.</p><p>“I’m so good at it! Come on, please?” She tugs on her daughter’s clothing as she speaks.</p><p>The girl can’t believe her eyes. Her mother—the same woman to whom a smile was a forbidden thing—was now pleading for attention. It’s too much. It’s all just too much.</p><p>With a sudden cry, the girl smacks her mother’s hand away. The reaction makes the older woman burst into tears.<br>THIS is who I was afraid of all these years? This pathetic creature?</p><p>The girl’s bewilderment finally gives way to rage.</p><p>Her mother had caused her so much grief. So much pain. And for what purpose? To what end?<br>As she stares at the sobbing thing before her, she wishes it would just hurry up and die.<br>Am I a terrible daughter? A terrible person?<br>The girl does not know the answers to these questions; she knows only that she cannot come up with even a single kind word for her mother. So instead she stands in place and listens to the sound of her weeping echo off the stale hospital walls.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Day I was Born Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The girl sits in a rough wooden chair and stares out the window. Days have passed since the shocking meeting with her mother, and she has yet to fully grasp the reality of the situation.</p><p>But after speaking with the doctor, it was decided that she would stay at the hospital, at least for a little while.</p><p>A letter was drafted to explain the circumstances and sent to her school.</p><p>And against all odds, the doctor’s kind and continuous treatment begins to have an effect.</p><p>Her mother’s mind begins to age, moving from that of a child to that of an adult.</p><p>And though it is a strange and bewildering time for the girl, she sits by her mother’s side through it all.</p><p>At first, it seemed as though there was no hope. But after a week, her expression changes.</p><p>It becomes more mature, and she begins to speak of romance. Over the span of a few weeks, the girl watches her mother gradually grow up. She now has the mental age of a young adult.</p><p>Her mother loved origami as a child. Her mother hated bugs as a teenager.</p><p>Her mother still hates carrots as an adult. The woman before her is always soft. Always kind.</p><p>But it is not the sort of kindness a mother shows her daughter.</p><p>One day, her mother awakens in a terrible state.</p><p>Her voice is the picture of confusion and helplessness.</p><p>“Stay with me, Grandma! Please stay with me!” The girl meets her mother’s gaze calmly.</p><p>She summons her courage. “Of course,” she finally replies. “I’ll be right here.”</p><p>Her mother has never called her anything but “Grandma.”</p><p>Perhaps, in her mind, she is not even a mother yet.</p><p>Which means that, in her mind, the girl does not actually exist. All of this lies heavy on the girl’s mind.</p><p>I hated my mother. And I thought she hated me. Did I ever want to be close to her?</p><p>And did she ever want to be close to me?<br> But the answers remain always out of reach.</p><p>Another week goes by, and her mother’s condition takes a turn for the worse.</p><p>Her arms are as weak and thin as the branches of the fruit tree outside the hospital.</p><p>She slips in and out of consciousness.</p><p>The doctor pulls the girl aside and says he does not expect her to live through the night.</p><p>So the girl stays by her side through the long dark, holding her wrinkled hand all the while.</p><p>The only light is the dim glow of an indifferent moon.</p><p>It illuminates her mother’s pained expression as she moans in her sleep.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyelids twitch open.</p><p>“Do you want some water?” asks the girl. Her mother shakes her head.</p><p>She opens her mouth as if to speak. Something is clearly troubling her.</p><p>“I have to talk to you, Grandma,” she says finally. Though weak, her mature voice carries the air of a childhood secret.</p><p>The girl merely nods, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>She begins to speak of children, and how conflicted she is by the idea.</p><p>“I don’t want a baby,” she says.<br>There it is…There it is.</p><p>Her mother had never wanted her. Not ever.</p><p>If her mother notices the pained expression and lowered head of her daughter, she pays it no mind and continues to speak. She tells of how she began having problems when she was a young woman. After a while, she finally sought medical help.</p><p>And in time, she was diagnosed with a mental illness.</p><p>It was this diagnosis that caused her husband to abandon her.</p><p>The girl raises her head. She had no idea about this—about<br>any<br> of it.</p><p>She had spent but a short time with her mother, and had not been nearly old enough to understand the truth of complex adult affairs. Even now, the story is so complicated that it threatens to blow away from her at any moment.</p><p>She talks of how her illness will eat away at her.</p><p>How it will change her. How it will hurt her and everyone she cares for.</p><p>She worries abut this. She worries without ceasing or pause.</p><p>If she were to ever have a child, she would surely hurt them as well. Despite how much…</p><p>Despite how<br>very<br> much…</p><p>She loves the child that lies inside her now.</p><p>Wet heat drips down the girl’s cheeks. It falls to the floor like slow rain.</p><p>As she listens to her mother’s confession, the girl’s anger and hatred finally begin to escape her body in the form of small drops at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Finally, her mother sighs and lays back. She closes her eyes.</p><p>Every worry of a life—every worry of a million lifetimes—seems to have contained itself in the dark circles beneath her eyes. The room grows silent as the girl squeezes her hand.</p><p>And for the first time since she came to the hospital…</p><p>For the first time in so long, she says… “Mom.”</p><p>Dawn breaks after an endless night.

His hair was as unruly as ever, shooting out and away from his head as if it desired to enter orbit.</p><p>“Are you really asking me that question? As I recall, I scored much higher than you on the last one.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. But I’m going to make up for it this time!”</p><p>“You’d better, because this is just getting embarrassing.”</p><p>We had bantered like this since the first day we met in the hallowed halls of the magick academy. Each semester we challenged each other to see who could score higher on the endless series of tests we were given, and each semester he somehow manages to keep up with me.</p><p>I always found this fact supremely annoying, because I didn’t see how he could possibly pull off such high scores while also being a complete slacker.</p><p>This semester’s contest was currently deadlocked at five wins each, and I’d sworn to study even harder so I could pull away from him before things came to a close.</p><p>Fortunately, the next test was in my best subject, so I felt confident I would be able to seal the deal.</p><p>When I reached the experiments room, I found my classmates buzzing about in preparation for the practical exam. Our test today was all about transmutation: changing a thing of one substance into another. It was a tricky problem that required a number of delicate, subtle skills; students who simply attacked it with raw magickal strength would quickly find their efforts ending in failure.</p><p>As the other students pulled out their various ores and plants, I slowly reached into my bag and removed a sleepy frog. I know it was a risky move—frogs are notoriously hard to transmute—but if I could pull it off, I’d certainly have the final win I was looking for.</p><p>I set the frog on my desk and began casting my spell. Light flowed from my staff and swirled around the animal, who seemed merely bored by the proceedings. As I worked, I began to form an image of the transmuted shape I was aiming for, being careful not to add too much or too little magick. I felt good. Confident. Almost cocky.</p><p>But then everything went wrong.</p><p>The magick I thought I’d conquered suddenly yanked against the reins, and the slow trickle of power became a surging waterfall. A million different colors of light blazed across the walls as my staff began to shake in my hands.</p><p>“Let go!” Cried my professor as she ran toward my station. When I hesitated a fraction of a second, she slammed her hands on the desk and screamed again. “NOW!”</p><p>The moment I released my grip on the staff, the other classmates begin to scream. The staff floated higher into the air, whirling like a maddened dervish as it poured more and more magick into the now very-much-concerned frog. The poor creature began to grow, swelling into the size of a watermelon, then a small dog, then a human. Skin stretched. Eyes bulged. Screams rang out anew.</p><p>And then…it exploded.</p><p>That was three days ago, and needless to say, I did not win the grade contest with my best friend. But honestly, I have much bigger issues on my mind right now—like the fact I’ve suddenly lost the ability to control even the smallest magickal spell.</p><p>As I hurry toward my room with my head hanging low, I hear students whispering behind me in the stairwell.</p><p>“Hey, did you hear about the exploding frog thing?”</p><p>I know—it’s SO disgusting! Apparently they were cleaning gung off the walls for hours.”</p><p>“Yeah, but do you know who’s responsible?”</p><p>I hear a giggle, then a whisper that sounds suspiciously like my name, and I suddenly want nothing more than to find a nice, warm hole to crawl into and live in forever.</p><p>“So sad—she used to be pretty talented. Hey, do you think it’s that Omen thing? The one that makes you unable to use magic?”</p><p>“I dunno, but I heard one of the older kids say that same thing.”</p><p>I Knew exactly what they were talking about—we all did. Rumors of the Omen had been swirling around the school since the day we arrived:</p><p>A magic user’s power is never more unstable than in the days leading up to their tenth birthday.</p><p>And if they cannot gain control over it before the full moon rises in the sky, they will never be able to use their power again.</p><p>I laughed it off when I first heard about it—we all did. But right now, laughing was the furthest thing from my mind. Because I’d celebrated my tenth birthday just a few days ago, and now there was only a week left until the next full moon.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: The Library’s Keeper<br>[<br>]</p><p>Five days until the full moon…</p><p>The thought of losing my magic terrifies me. But as I sit motionless in the classroom and try not to consider this possibility, my best friend wanders over and begins our usual banter.</p><p>“Aw, you look down. Did losing to me make you that sad?”</p><p>Usually, I’d let such snarky comments go. But this time, I get up and storm off without a word—because I know he’ll just laugh if I tell him what I’m thinking.</p><p>Eventually, I make my way to the library and take a moment to breathe in the atmosphere. Bookshelves scrape the ceiling, while haphazard shelf placement makes it less organized than an ancient maze. If I’m going to find a clue—if there’s some way to undo the curse that haunts me—I’m going to find it here.</p><p>Not this one. This is no good. Nope. Not this one either.</p><p>I’m concentrating so hard on finding my book, I don’t even realize that I’m lost. And when I finally recognize that fact, I’m so startled that I take an involuntary step backward and collide with a bookshelf—which immediately spins on its axis and sends me crashing through a revolving door.</p><p>I am floating.</p><p>Slowly, I force my eyes open and see that several of the tomes which had fallen from the shelf are drifting gently in front of me.</p><p>Somehow—some<br>way<br>—the books and I are slowly falling down, down, down an endless hallway lined as far as the eye can see with shelves.</p><p>I don’t know if there is a bottom. Or a top. Heck, maybe I’ll just float like this until thirst and starvation take me.</p><p>But then, someone speaks.</p><p>“TELL ME THY NAME.”</p><p>“Sorry, but where are you? And, um,<br>who<br> are you?” I try to put some force into my voice to hide my fear, but it all falls apart at the end.</p><p>“I AM THE KEEPER OF THE LIBRARY.”</p><p>“Oh. That’s, um…I’ve never heard of you.”</p><p>“THOU HAST INTRUDED UPON MY DOMAIN, AND NOW MUST ANSWER THREE QUESTIONS TRUE. IF THINE ANSWERS SATISFY ME, I SHALL GRANT THY MOST CHERISED DESIRE.”</p><p>I have to be careful here—<br>incredibly<br> careful. The first thing they teach you when you arrive at the academy is to be wary of powerful mages. There’s strength in their questions, you see…and penalties if you lie. But I also know this is my best—and maybe only—chance to find the answers I need.</p><p>“All right, then. Ask away.”</p><p>“WHAT STRIKES THE GREATEST FEAR IN THEY HEART?”</p><p>“My greatest fear? Um, well, I suppose I’m afraid of disappointing my teachers.”</p><p>Sort of a boring answer, but also very much true.</p><p>“IN WHAT DOST THOU PLACE THE MOST TRUST?”</p><p>“My own power.”</p><p>I mean, I came to a floating hallway to keep it, so I’d better trust it.</p><p>“THY FINAL QUESTION COMES.”</p><p>I try to swallow, but my throat might as well be made of sand.</p><p>“WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS TO THEE?”</p><p>“Most precious? That’d be my…”</p><p>“Magick” is what I want to say. Magick. I mean, of<br>course<br> it’s my magick. But for some reason my mind decides this is a great time to go running off on its own, and hear myself say:</p><p>“My family.”</p><p>Oh god. Oh no. I’m in real trouble now. I feel my body come to a halt and reverse direction, meaning I’m now floating UP. Expecting some kind of horrible punishment, I squeeze myself into the smallest ball I can and shut my eyes tight. But then…</p><p>“THAT ANSWER HAS SAVED THY LIFE.”</p><p>The next thing I know, I’m standing in the library entrance. At my feet is a book I’d never seen, flipped open to a page for a potion that enhances a person’s magickal ability.</p><p>Was I dreaming?<br>Am<br> I dreaming?</p><p>A weird feeling settles over me as I look around at the library, I expect something strange—something higher—but all I see before me is the same, quiet space I have so come to love.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: The Vile Butterflies<br>[<br>]</p><p>Two days until the full moon.</p><p>I’ve been busy collecting ingredients for my magick-enhancement elixir ever since I found that tome in the library. I feel myself losing strength by the day, and I’m panicking. I have to do whatever it takes to secure the ingredients by the night of the full moon.</p><p>Currently, I’m slogging my way through a dark forest ripe with magick, collecting the various items I need. When my satchel is finally filled to bursting with a supply of herbs, I turn to leave and notice a little butterfly hovering around me.</p><p>Have I seen this butterfly before?</p><p>The front side of its gray wings glow faintly. I count one butterfly, then another, then another. Soon the creatures blanket my entire vision, so I swipe my hand through them to clear a path.</p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>The sudden voice makes me jump, and I whirl around in an attempt to find the source.</p><p>“Pffft! This kid has no idea who’s talking.”</p><p>Yeah, she seems like a real dum-dum, all right!”</p><p>Laughter ripples out before me in waves, and I suddenly realize the source of the voices are the butterflies themselves. At that moment, I remember where I’d seen them: a textbook I was glancing at back at school. These are no normal insects, but instead beautiful, cruel creatures that feed on the darkest parts of the human heart. And if you inhale their scales, you are subjected to an increasingly horrible series of illusions.</p><p>“This isn’t a place for a loser like you.”</p><p>“Aww, did that make you feel bad? It’s true, though, you useless little witch.”</p><p>After a theatric series of insults, the butterflies gather in one spot, almost as if they are a single organism. They then take the shape of a human—one I know all too well.</p><p>“I’m disappointed in you. A witch without magick has no value to anyone.”</p><p>It’s my alchemy professor, and while I know it isn’t real, it looks and sounds exactly like the actual thing. As I stare in horror, the insects transform into classmates, villagers, and friends, each one pelting me with horrible statements.</p><p>And then…</p><p>“What’s got you looking so miserable?”</p><p>It’s the boy—my best friend.</p><p>“No…Not this…”</p><p>“You’ve always been ugly, you know that? Plus, you’re always arguing with me over one thing or another. Still, you’ve got good grades, which is why I keep pretending to be your friend.”</p><p>My eyes fill up with tears. He would never say something like this to me.<br>Never.<br> And yet, what if he’s been thinking such things all this time and never told me?</p><p>“But without magick? Useless. Just another dumb little witch. So…bye.”</p><p>I let out a strangled cry and reach for him, then stop myself. This isn’t real—these are just creatures taking his form in an attempt to eat my heart. And even if he<br>did<br> think such things…</p><p>“I won’t lose to you!”</p><p>I grip my staff and attempt to launch a fireball, but am rewarded with a tiny poof and a pathetic spark instead. Was this actually happening? Was my magick really so weak? My best friend cackles madly at my shocked expression, then slowly dissolves into a mass of swarming butterflies. But just before he fades completely, he gives one last twist of the knife:</p><p>“There’s no place for you here. There’s no place<br>anywhere.<br>“</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: The Stone Giant<br>[<br>]</p><p>Tonight is the first night of the full moon since my 10th birthday—the last chance to get my magick back before I lose it forever.</p><p>Warm rays of sunset light beam through the window, guiding me as I walk through the dusty corridor. Suddenly, I hear the horrible sound of stone scraping on stone behind me, and realize I’ve found what I came for.</p><p>Got you.</p><p>The potion recipe in my book said I needed to secure the heart of a massive stone golem before nightfall, and I’d come to this crumbling manor to find one. Suppressing my overwhelming desire to run, I reach into one of the hidden pockets of my robe and withdraw a small arcane pearl I’d created for this very moment.</p><p>“I’ll see you in hell, buddy!” I scream as I hurl the object into the oncoming creature. There is a bright flash of light, followed by a deep rumble that echoes throughout the manor. But then…</p><p>“Oh. That’s not good at all.”</p><p>When the smoke clears, the golem is unharmed—my precious pearl didn’t even slow it down. As my legs begin to tremble, it presses me up against a wall with its massive bulk. Its eyes peer down at me from the ceiling, questioning, unblinking. Then it raises one enormous hand and prepares to bring it down, ending my life as a tiny little splat on the floor that no one will even recognize come the morning.</p><p>“This way!”</p><p>As a familiar voice cries out, a bolt of lightning knocks the golem’s killing blow aside. I turn in wonderment to see the boy standing there—my best friend. As I dash past the grumbling golem and to his side, he casts another powerful spell at my enemy.</p><p>“I’m barely slowing this damn thing down!”</p><p>I know that, just as I know there’s only one way out of this: I’ll tell him to run and save himself while I distract the creature. But before I can speak this plan aloud, he holds his staff out and blesses me with a familiar crooked smile.</p><p>“Here,” he says in a low voice. “Hold my staff. We’ll hit this jerk with a combined spell like we learned in class!”</p><p>“No! I can’t! I can’t use magick anymore!”</p><p>No sense in trying to hide it anymore; the cat is not only out of the bag, it’s running off down the road. I expect him to turn and leave in a cloud of disgust when I say this, but to my astonishment, his smile just grows wider.</p><p>“Wrong! You’re an<br>amazing<br> spellcaster! You just have to trust in yourself. Now get ready, because that ugly thing’s coming right for us!”</p><p>His voice sparks a mad sense of encouragement in me, and almost without realizing it, I reach out and grip the staff. Moments later, a whirlpool of light spills out of his weapon. A gust of wind whips up, threatening to blow me away. And as I stand in the swirling light, I feel my body being filled with magick.</p><p>Oh my god…This is incredible!</p><p>This is our magick; our powers intermingling to make a storm of unimaginable ferocity. The roof detaches and soars away. Walls crumble. Pillars explode. And at the end of it all, the once-mighty golem is nothing but a heap of rocks on the floor.</p><p>“How did you know I was here?” I ask as I dust myself off.</p><p>“You’d been acting weird lately, so I peeked at your notes and saw something about creating an elixir, as well as the location of this place.” He pauses for a moment to dislodge a small pebble from his shoulder, then looks at me again. “Say, do you remember what our professor said about mages and witches having really unstable magick at the age of ten?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Yeah, that whole thing about us ‘losing our magick’ is just a superstition, but it’s based around the fact stuff tends to run amok at this age.”</p><p>As his words settle over me, I realize my magick worked perfectly fine when we cast the combined spell. “So, um… You knew I was upset about all of this?”</p><p>“Yeah, and I was worried.”</p><p>His voice is both gentle and warm, and I have to resist a sudden urge to burst into tears as I hear it. Shame rises in my heart as I realize how stupid it was to think this friend might have abandoned me if I lost my magick, when the whole time he was more concerned about me than I ever imagined.</p><p>“Um, thanks,” I manage as I pull my hat lower over my eyes. I don’t want him to see me like this, but he just bursts out laughing.</p><p>“Hey, of course! You’re family, after all.”</p><p>Family.<br> Though I’m happy to hear him use that word, I’m not exactly sure how to feel about it.</p><p>“Hey, so let’s get out of here, yeah?”</p><p>“Yes. Let’s.”</p><p>As we walk home beneath a shimmering full moon, I deliberately take slower steps than necessary, all so the moment might last just a little bit longer.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>To the Crybaby<br>[<br>]</p><p>Look.
