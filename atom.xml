Bound to a dazzling prison others name a palace. My elegant fetters are contained in the title of princess. Only once, in my youth, did I comprehend freedom.</p><p>When I was young, I grew tired of my stuffy life in the palace and impulsively fled. For the first time, I walked the nighttime streets of the city, where a fantastical atmosphere welcomed me with open arms.</p><p>I walked and walked until I no longer knew where I was.</p><p>I couldn’t see the palace, or even the mighty spire atop it. Loneliness overcame me then, causing tears to tremble in the corners of my eyes.</p><p>“Is something troubling you, young lady?” said the voice of an old woman from somewhere behind me. Relieved that help had finally arrived, I suddenly burst out weeping. So loud was my wailing that all those walking the streets stopped to look. But the old woman gently took my hand and led me away. She led me to her home—a small domicile where she told the fortunes of others.</p><p>Crystals glowed faintly. Exotic rugs tickled my feet. I cannot remember the fortune she scried for me…</p><p>But I will never forget the shock that pierced my heart in that moment.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I eventually came to love the night. One reason—perhaps the most important—was that I could escape the palace and find new sides of myself. The day I met the old woman, I made of her a request:</p><p>“Please make me your apprentice and teach me to divine futures.”</p><p>Though she agreed, her teachings were harsh. “People place their lives in the hands of fortunes,” she would say. Under her strict tutelage, I gleaned the secrets of divination. Eventually, I began to perform readings for others under her watchful eye. I was cautious: If ever I saw a bad result, I worded it in a way that sounded positive. In the palace, I yearned for night. In the old woman’s house, I divined futures. For a time, this was my life.</p><p>One day, when the old woman was away, a redheaded couple came to have their fortunes told. I was overconfident by then, and thought I could do it without her help. As the crystal ball sparked to life, I witnessed a catastrophic future. And I found I did not have the words to change it.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>A rumor drew a crowd to the bay. A man and woman fought over the end of their relationship, and the woman ended up drowning the man. The woman had short, striking red hair. Red hair was unusual in this nation. I realized at once she was the same woman whose fortune I had told. </p><p>That was when I knew: I had the power to manipulate the lives of others through divination. To that point, I had nothing in my life save the title of “princess.” But now? Now I had a secret power.</p><p>All that awaited me, however, was the old woman’s rage. She blamed me for warping the fates of others through my inexperience. All my excuses fell on deaf ears, and she threw me from her home. The last thing she said to me was this:</p><p>“You have no right to tell the fortune of another.”</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Days later, as the sun dawned on the city, another crowd gathered. They were a mob, and they ripped the old woman’s house down with their own hands. They screamed and trampled the remains, destroying everything. The old woman’s prized divination tools were buried beneath the rubble. </p><p>And I watched. And I smiled.</p><p>I struggled to keep back the laughter bubbling in my throat. I had used my powers selfishly to unleash the mob. For even after she sent me away, I continued to foretell the future. I could not find the strength to stop. I worked quietly, propped up alone in a dark back alley. I told fortunes. I turned people into my playthings. I could never go back. Because the day I ripped that couple apart, I felt something new. That realization? That I could change someone’s fate?</p><p>It was deep. Powerful. Distorted.<br>It was<br>.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Back when the woman used to have her smile…</p><p>A small country lies nestled between dry sand and fertile sea, its capital an assortment of haphazardly placed spires and domed rooves.</p><p>“Before it sits a vast desert, one that claims the lives of any who might threaten the city.”</p><p>“Behind it lies a vast ocean, one where ships laden with precious cargo from across the world come and go.”</p><p>Within the capital, there is a palace. Within the palace, there is a corridor. And dashing through the corridor, there is a single girl. Though she runs with wild abandon, none dare scold her. For she is the country’s princess.</p><p>“Mother!” she cries as she bursts into a room. “You called for me!?”</p><p>The room boasts high ceilings and cool breezes reminiscent of the finest desert resort. Finely-crafted furniture fills every corner. The person the girl calls “mother” lays claim to this place, as well as the rest of the country. She is queen of this land; all of its prosperity flows to her.</p><p>“I did call you,” the queen begins. “For today, I would speak with you of marriage.” She hands the princess a scroll. Written at its top is the name of a country the princess does not recognize. As well as a terrifying phrase:<br>marriage of state<br>. </p><p>As royalty, the princess lacks the right to choose her husband. And though she knew this moment was coming, she cannot hide her concern.</p><p>“Worry not,” says the queen as she senses her daughter’s unease. “I have selected a most excellent partner.”</p><p>Memories from her life come rushing back to the princess. She recalls conversations with her beloved mother, as well as her secret life as a fortune teller—a thing of which only her lady-in-waiting is aware. It had all taken place here, in this land betwixt sand and sea. As tears well in the girl’s eyes, the queen pulls her into an embrace.</p><p>“All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter’s happiness.” The tears are loosed now, flowing down her face and onto the uncaring marble below. But the girl knows her mother has her best interests at heart. And in that moment, it is enough.</p><p>A lengthy procession snakes through silvery, moonlit sands. The princess’s procession. She sits inside her litter, surrounded before and behind by a wealth of effusive gifts personally selected by her mother the queen. Bored, she gazes out through a mesh-covered window at the brilliant night sky. She is heading for a land rich in ore and precious metals. Her mother has long desired such things, and hopes that marrying her daughter to the country’s ruling family will allow her to secure them under advantageous conditions. But first, the princess must earn the king’s fancy and prove to his ministers that she is an asset of value. It will be difficult, time-consuming work. But the girl is confident. For she is particularly adept at reading the hearts of others and manipulating them to her liking. She has spent many a long night wandering the city in the guise of a fortune teller, and such pursuits for people’s true essences should prove useful here.</p><p>Nerve. Curiosity. Ambition. These things and more well within her as she sits inside her litter and watches the breaking dawn.</p><p>Finally, the procession reaches its destination. The princess is hurried off to an astonishingly vast room so she might prepare for her wedding. She is dressed in a spotless white dress stitched with brilliant gold thread that catches the light. The army of maids who surround her swoon and sigh at the sight. But what captures the princess’s heart is not the gorgeous dress, but the shape of the city against the horizon. For the buildings outside her window shine even more brilliantly than her dress. Unlike her gritty, sand-covered home, this city is a land enveloped in white, dreamlike beauty.</p><p>Suddenly, the door swings wide, causing the maids to immediately bow their heads. “Ah, my new wife. At last we meet.”</p><p>The princess looks up to see a handsome, bearded man in the prime of his life. He is the king—the ruler of this land, and the man who would be her husband. Taking her hand, the king leads her to a courtyard facing the palace. Waiting there is a large portable shrine, as well as a sea of citizens.</p><p>“Welcome to our nation,” says the king as the people burst into a raucous cheer. Dancing petals fill her vision. Music swirls around her. In every corner of the courtyard, people are drinking and dancing with wanton abandon.</p><p>“Hail the new queen!”</p><p>“Long life to our new queen!”</p><p>“Pray look this way, Queen!”</p><p>Princess and king sit in the portable shrine as it begins slowly making its way down the crowded city streets. Today the girl begins a new life in this dazzling land. A place where everyone receives her with warmth and grace. Any doubts she harbored about earning the love of the king and his people quickly fall away. She will give her life to this land—for her mother’s sake as well as her own. She will live with the handsome king beside her and do all she can to see her new people happy. With a small nod, she makes peace with her decision.</p><p>“Attention, everyone!” cries the king suddenly. “It is time for today’s entertainment!”</p><p>The mood of the people immediately turns from excitement to frenzy. With one hand still gently grasping the princess’s own, the king receives an axe from one of his retainers. The polished blade reflects the sunlight. The worn handle is blackened with dirt.</p><p>“What are you going to do?” asks the bemused princess. “It is time you learned how we enjoy ourselves in this land,” he responds. Together, they step down from the shrine and into the sea of people. He swings the axe. Once. Twice. Again. With each swing, a citizen’s head soars away into the air, followed by a brilliant fountain of blood. The princess hears no screams. No panic. All is naught but blood and fevered cheers. The brilliant, unspoiled plaza is soon dyed the deepest crimson. The princess’s beautiful white dress is bright vermilion. She screams, then, a sound lost amidst the revelry.</p><p>“Onward, my queen!” cries the king as he leads her through the crowd swinging his gore-soaked axe. Whether she follows him by choice or force is a question she cannot answer. Her every movement is greeted with a shower of blood, one more step along the path of a wedding most bloody. She suddenly feels her carefully crafted plans wither and die inside her. Those she had manipulated in her life were normal people. Easy people. The type who might come to a fortune teller for advice. But the handsome king she is to marry is something altogether different. He is a man cruel beyond all measure. A man whose senses have abandoned him. And as the people of this mad king eagerly die before him with grins plastered across their faces…</p><p>The princess can only look on in horror.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A small kingdom lies nestled between sand and sea. The princess of this kingdom was sent to a faraway land and married off so her beloved mother might find greater prosperity. But to her horror, her new husband is a bloodthirsty, mad king who slaughtered his own people for entertainment at their wedding.</p><p>Days after the bloody ceremony, the woman stares out the window with haunted eyes. The king has given her a vast room with a stunning view. Its massive windows look out over the plaza where the wedding took place. There, people chat idly, lazing about beneath the gentle rays of the sun. The king bathed the floors and walls of the plaza with blood on that day of the frenzied feast. But now, all has been returned to normal, the red walls and floors painted white once more. She recalls what a retainer said to her about the paint:</p><p>“Aye, my new queen. It’s made from ash, as well as shells harvested from the nearby waters.”</p><p>She looks out across the country again. The high castle walls, the floors, and the houses are all covered in that same spotless white. She understands now why that is. For her new husband—the land’s king—engages in his bloody hobby on an almost daily basis. She tears her gaze away from the plaza, ready to enjoy a quiet moment to herself. But her reverie is interrupted by the pealing of a bell. It rings once. Twice. A third time. This bell sits at the highest point of the city and can be heard for miles. Its ringing is how the king summons her. She quickly readies herself and makes her way to his side.</p><p>She finds him in a circular arena at the center of the palace—a place where fighting tournaments are held.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you, my beautiful new queen!” he says as he scoops her into an embrace and deposits her in the empty seat beside him. She has been summoned here so she might watch the upcoming battle. Two stout and scarred men stand in the arena. The king takes great joy in such events; he makes them pummel each other until one lies dead, then strikes down the winner with his own hand. But the woman cannot revel in such an abattoir, and so looks away. Her eyes alight on a spire that stands outside the palace. Blood clings to its sides like thick honey. The day prior, the king had amused himself by gathering people at the spire while he skewered criminals atop it. Even the worst slavers and criminals would find such acts unthinkable in the princess’s homeland. But here, they are commonplace. Games, even.</p><p>He is mad<br> she thinks.<br>He is<br> utterly<br>mad<br>.</p><p>How did he possibly trick my mother into accepting this marriage?</p><p>Without warning, the king gently squeezes the princess’s hand, leaning his handsome face close to her own.</p><p>“I hope you are enjoying the game,” he whispers into her ear. Such “games” are naught but means to toy with the lives of others. Whenever he indulges himself in one, he calls her to his side. He drags her from one bloodbath to the next, just as he did at the wedding. And as she gazes at the mighty walls that protect this gorgeous land, a thought occurs to her:</p><p>This country is beautiful.</p><p>Yet it is nothing but a trap to lure in prey—an inescapable prison.</p><p>As the sun sets and shadows stretch across the city, the princess is finally freed from her husband’s latest amusement. She is beginning to feel herself growing numb to the daily parade of tragedies that unfold before her. It is a realization that<br>terrifies<br> her. Only here, in her own room, can she manage to find a sense of calm.</p><p>A full moon hangs in the sky. She steps onto the balcony, gazes up at the sky, and thinks of her home. Of her mother. As this country’s new queen, she has been treated most excellently. But her days are also filled with loneliness—and pain. Every one of the attendants who accompanied her on her journey has been slaughtered. She is utterly alone. But she will carry on. It is her duty to her country. To her mother. As that thought crosses her mind, she finds herself briefly refreshed. She whirls on one heel and makes to return to the room. But before she can move, she notices a faint mark on the wall. It would be invisible if not for the light of the full moon. She follows in the direction it points and finds herself facing one of her bedposts. She reaches behind the post until she feels something solid.</p><p>A diary.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of her bed, she begins to read. The author is one of the previous women sent here to marry the king. It includes observations regarding the nation, plus small grievances about her life and the king’s routine. The woman had noticed how people called her the “new queen.” But that raised the question: Where did the previous queen—or<br>queens<br>—go? As she reads, she finds her answer. And when she does, her mouth cracks opens in a silent scream.</p><p>The writing is hurried. Sloppy.</p><p>While he shows his wives deep affection, he always grows tired of them within five full moons past the wedding.</p><p>After that, he disposes of them and begins looking for a new wife.</p><p>So many queens have died by his hand.</p><p>There is more to the diary, but she is too scared to turn the page. Her mind whirls. She tries to think, but cannot.</p><p>How many full moons has it been?</p><p>The bell tolls suddenly. Once. Twice. A pause…and then a third time. The king is calling for her. But this time, the princess is frozen in place. She imagines the misfortune that awaits her and feels her heart clench. Every day is a game for her new king. And soon, it will be her turn to play. Oddly, the next thing she thinks of is her mother’s kind face.</p><p>“All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter’s happiness.”</p><p>Her mother had said that, turning the words into a kind of tiny prayer. A prayer that she might be happy in her new life, even if it was a marriage not of her own choosing. She does not wish to break her kind mother’s heart by dying in a foreign land. For she knows her death would bring her great sadness.</p><p>I must return home alive. I must see my mother again.</p><p>And so she quietly makes up her mind to escape her new country—and to escape her king.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>In a faraway country, a mad king toys with people’s lives. One night, the woman who was now his wife found a diary in her room. The author was a queen who came here long before her—a queen that had since vanished. Written on the inside was a terrifying truth: Many queens had met their end by the king’s own hand. This is why the woman knows she will soon fall victim to her husband’s madness.</p><p>“The way you wield your sword is simply beautiful, my darling! You enchant me!” With a smile, she grasps the king’s hand. Clutching it as she showers in the blood of her subjects. Her words prompt the king to adjust his grip as he mows through another group of people. She found a truth in the old diary: After five full moons spent with his new queen, the king will grow weary and dispose of her. She knows her life is in his hands. So she puts on her best act in the faint hope he might not tire of her.</p><p>The king’s game comes to a close. All goes quiet for another night. The princess steps from her bed and slips silently into the city. She walks in shadow, her eyes peering out from the dark. The walls are too high. The guards too numerous. Though this country is at peace, security is abnormally tight. All so her husband might create a stalwart cage from which none might escape. The woman acts amiably during her daylight hours so she might delay her impending demise. But she is also buying time. Time to prepare. Time to ready herself. Time to escape.</p><p>The king’s guards are ever watchful. During meals. During sleep. Even at the privy. If she is to outfox so cautious and clever a man, she needs more time. She looks up at the moon, calculating how many days remain to her. All the while searching for a way home. Her only clues are those left in the diary. But time passes without mercy, and the people no longer refer to her as the “new” queen. Finally, one night, she sees the moon hanging round and low in the sky. It is the fifth time she has seen such a sight. She has assembled everything she needs to escape. A sack stuffed with rations. A skin of water. A tightly wound rope. She slings her things over her shoulder and steps onto the windowsill. Moving on nimble feet, she lands in the palace garden. Suddenly, a voice rings out.</p><p>“Taking in the night air, my queen?”</p><p>She whirls around, her heart in her throat. The king stands before her clutching an axe. The bell tolls. It rings once. Twice. A pause…and then a third time. Her final summons. Before she can move, the king’s hand lashes out and secures her arm in an iron grip. Ignoring her screams, he begins pulling her toward their private bath. The shrewd king has seen through the woman’s actions. Many queens before her have attempted escape. All have failed. All have died. The king boasts proudly of his feats as he steps into the bath. He begins to fiddle with a hidden mechanism somewhere in the center.</p><p>“And now, my dear wife, we begin our final game.”</p><p>As he speaks, a small hole opens in the bath. Water floods through the hole, draining the bath and revealing a small staircase. It is the entrance to a hidden room known only to the king. The pair makes their way down the stairs in silence. At the bottom is a stone room illuminated by faint torchlight. When the princess enters it, despair falls over her features. But the king only smiles wider, his face made all the more handsome for it. The secret room has but one purpose: killing his queen. The king speaks then, praising the woman for amusing him for five full moons. As he does so, a stone falls over the stairway, cutting off all hope of escape. The room is filled with tools the woman has never before seen. But she needs no explanation as to their purpose: They exist to break people. The king lays his hand on one such tool and gives her a crooked, twisted smile.</p><p>“This is your final job, my queen.”</p><p>It is a scene the king has played out time and again. But this time, something different happens. The woman does not cry. She does not beg. Instead, she looks him right in the eye and begins to giggle.</p><p>“Does this amuse you?” he growls. It is the first time she has ever seen him angry—likely because she has never shown him anything but outright deference. As she continues to giggle, a range of emotions wash over the king’s face. Anger turns to rage, before slowly giving way to a hint of doubt. And then, for the briefest of moments, fear.</p><p>The woman does not let the chance escape. She leaps into the corner of the room and picks up a hidden spear. Before the king can even draw breath, she plunges it into his chest. Her attack is nowhere near powerful enough to fell so large and strong a man as her new husband. Yet he begins to foam at the mouth before dropping to one knee. For you see, a powerful poison has been lathered on the spear head.</p><p>“You thought this room yours alone,” whispers the woman in his ear. “But it is not.”</p><p>As the king writhes and thrashes on the ground, the princess tosses the diary in front of him. It is the work not of one queen, but<br>all<br> of them. Each poor soul who married the king wrote down what she knew before dying—and the previous queen was the one who finally figured out the location of the secret room beneath the bath.</p><p>I don’t know if I’ll be able to escape. But whoever is reading this, you can be the one to end this. You must.</p><p>That was the final entry in the diary. And so, the woman snuck into the hidden room ahead of time, ensuring the sacrifices of the previous queens would not be in vain. The king relished in tormenting the weak, and his wives were no exception. But he took too much joy in such proceedings, and so made himself vulnerable. Which is how his latest wife has now come to stand over his pathetic, quivering form.</p><p>“My poor king,” she says in a mocking, melodic voice. “Does that hurt? Would you like me to hold your hand?” But she receives no response. At long last, the mad king is dead. She pulls a string in the corner of the room, causing the floor to slide open, revealing a deep pit. Unfathomable amounts of blood have dried and stuck to the walls like the massive artery of a long-dead giant. It is where the king threw the bodies of his wives when he was done with them. The princess gazes into the deep, dark hole. Beyond lies a future not written in the diary. But she produces her rope and carefully vanishes into the pit all the same.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>On the night of the fifth full moon, the woman kills her husband and slips free of her palace prison. All so she might return to the mother who loves and worries for her deeply. Before she left, she found the sight of her home to be tired and uninteresting. But now the haphazard spires and clustered domes strike her as beauty personified. She is back in the land wreathed by sea and sand. Her birthplace. Her home.</p><p>Once she escaped the mad king’s grasp, she used what little treasure and rations she had to barter passage through the desert. Now having returned, she sets her sights on the royal palace and limps her way through bustling city streets. She is surrounded by market stalls selling rare spices and exotic fabrics her mother has obtained through trade. None of the lands she passed through on her journey home were so lively—or so bountiful.</p><p>Mother truly is amazing<br>, she thinks.</p><p>When her mother was born, this nation was a poor and barren wasteland. But her mother cultivated it, negotiated with distant countries, and brought great wealth to their shores. The palace is close now. So close. Though she passes many citizens on the street, none realize she is the princess. The scent of blood and decay hangs all around her. Her body is coated in dust. All who see her turn away in disgust. She is nothing to them. Some filthy beggar. Some wretch. But she cares not, because she is<br>alive<br>. That truth is all that matters now.</p><p>As she walks the palace’s unending corridors, retainers and maids look at her with varying expressions. Some regard her with curiosity. Some show relief. But mostly, what she sees is shock.</p><p>“Mother!” Her hoarse voice sounds for the first time in ages as she bursts into her mother’s room and collapses on the floor. Just as when they first spoke of marriage, her mother sits at the far end of a long table. She is queen. The room belongs to her, as does the country. When the princess sees her mother’s face, relief floods her heart. Ignoring the pain of her parched throat, she begins a rapid-fire retelling of how she escaped the mad king.</p><p>Once she finishes her breathless tale, she gives her mother a smile and waits for her own in return. But it does not come. Instead, there is only disappointment. It is a wholly unexpected reaction—one which causes the princess to reel.</p><p>“Why did you come back?” asks her mother softly. The princess blinks, befuddled. She thought her mother would be delighted to see her. She thought she would sweep her up in her arms and offer words of gratitude for the daughter who risked all to make her happy.</p><p>“I cannot be happy if you are not happy,” says the queen coolly. “So I needed you to be happy in your new home. No matter what.”</p><p>As the princess tries desperately to still her reeling mind, she stops and takes in her surroundings. Uncountable maids and servants flit to and fro through the palace corridors. They carry precious timber. Rare spices. Great bolts of silk. Materials used for funerals. Her mother sinks low in her chair and gazes into space for a moment before continuing.</p><p>“Of course the mad king tried to kill you. He kills all his wives. But since you’ve come back, I suppose there’s little use for…” She trails off and waves a hand in the air. “All of<br>this<br>.”</p><p>She claps at a nearby retainer, who bows and awaits instruction. “Cancel my daughter’s funeral, and do it now! Do you have<br>any<br> idea how much this is costing me?”</p><p>The maids and servants immediately stop setting up the funeral trappings and begin tearing them down instead.</p><p>But why?</p><p>Before the princess can ask the question in her mind, the queen tells her everything. The mad king’s country, while mostly insignificant, holds great quantities of ore and precious metals. In exchange for a share of those resources, royal families the world over send their daughters there to be sacrifices. Her mother has known this since the day the princess was born. She waited years for her daughter to come of age so she could send her off to be slaughtered. All this was done so the country she built with her own own hands might become even more powerful. So she might obtain the future she envisioned for herself. But the princess is both clever and pragmatic, and she accepts this new reality far faster than most. Her mother has not betrayed her. Oh no. For one cannot betray a thing they were never loyal to in the first place. The princess slowly closes her eyes. She wavers in place, noting dimly how her body hurts in ways she never imagined it could.</p><p>“Yes, well, it seems I’ll have to increase security so you don’t escape next time,” says her mother. Having thus cleansed her daughter’s wound with salt, the queen and her attendants scuttle away. She does not even take the time to spare a final glance for her daughter. Time passes. A minute. Hours. The princess walks alone down an endless stone corridor. No smile graces her face now. The mad king had constructed a prison. Yet when she finally escaped, she found herself trapped in another. It is a cage she will never be able to flee. All because she was born a princess. All because she is her mother’s daughter. And having realized this truth, her once-brilliant smile is lost forever to the cruel reality of despair.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

Each day is exactly the same as the last, and I find myself in an ever-deepening rut.</p><p>, I think,<br>.</p><p>The traveler I pass wears a platinum ring. The merchant before me proudly shows off a vase housing a beautiful flower. Before I know it, both ring and vase are mine.</p><p>There are three rules to thievery. One: Keep distance between yourself and fellow thieves. Two: Touch your tools with your ring finger first. Three: Let the shadows guide your escape. Stick to these, and you will officially be a thief. I say this to no one; I repeat it only to myself. How long has this been my life? I no longer even remember what bread bought with my own money tastes like.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I feel a gaze on me as I sidle through the back alleys of the city.</p><p>A pair of eyes shine in the darkness, and a child steps into the light. The starving child examines the bread in my hand with a stare powerful enough to kill. I beckon him over. I do not do this out of spite. It’s just a way to pass the time. A game. I show the child some beans I’ve stolen. I hide them in one of my fists and ask him to choose which of them holds the prize. If he is correct, the beans will be his. Once I see light return to his eyes, the game begins.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>First match. I win.</p><p>Second match. I win again.</p><p>Third match. Care to guess? …Ah, right you are. I win.</p><p>Hunger dulls the child’s thoughts. I have given him every chance to see through my ruse. For I’m cheating him, you see. There is no way he can win. We play until the sun sets, and I never lose. He does not realize what is happening. Not even at the very end. The child cries and cries at his loss, but you know what they say: Temporary charity does nothing for a person in need. I leave the child with one parting thought:</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Even the greatest of thieves make mistakes. Even me.</p><p>This day, a fruit I stole from a stall slips through my fingers. How many years has it been since I was so exposed? Ah, but the fault is not all mine, for the stallkeeper has gone to great lengths to safeguard his merchandise. No sane person covers their products in oil—yet I curse myself all the same for not seeing it. Alas, hunger dulls the thoughts.</p><p>As I rush through the market, I glance behind me. Standing beside the bellowing stallkeeper is the child. The very one who lost to my tricks. Though his movements are clumsy, he uses the commotion I created to steal a good deal of fruit.</p><p>“Good for you.”</p><p>That is all I say before melting into the shadows. Time to separate myself from a fellow thief. For this is one of the rules, after all.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>This is a tale from when the boy was making a name for himself as a thief…</p><p>“Sorry, boss, but this is as far as we go.”</p><p>A simple camp sits on the desert sands. The band of brigands who encircle the fire look out into the distance, fear writ large on their faces. For there gazes rest on the White Fortress—also known as the Thieves’ Graveyard. Nestled between desert and sea, this great castle awes all who lay eyes upon it. Countless men have snuck inside in search of treasure, countless men have lost their lives.</p><p>The brigands at the fire voice their displeasure to their leader, a young thief of meager years. The power and influence of the band has grown rapidly, and they came to the ends of the desert to make an even greater name for themselves. The young thief yells at his ragged men. He knows they must be alert at all times if they are to claim the treasures of the White Fortress. But his fellows are overcome with fear at the sight of the castle, so much so that some take the path of the coward and flee.</p><p>The older men yell. The younger weep. The thief sighs as he watches the scene unfold.</p><p>A long line of people stand at the entrance to the White Fortress, queued neatly before its impossibly high gates. They are the nouveau riche, come to attend a fine banquet. As they wait, beggars mill about, hoping for the occasional alms or act of charity. The thief weaves his way to the front of the line as though he belongs there. The guard manning the gates stares at him, shocked.</p><p>“Begging your pardon, sir, but the line begins over—“</p><p>“I do not appreciate being made to wait,” interrupts the thief. His attitude is haughty, his voice filled with unwavering confidence. It is a quality held by only a certain kind of person. It cannot be learned or affected; it is something that must be born into. The boy is clad in resplendent clothing. The jewels decorating his garments glint beneath the torches of the gate. Yet though he wears naught but fakes, his attitude tricks the eye into belief. A moment later, the guard concludes he is different from the nouveau riche, and his gruff expression becomes a cordial smile.</p><p>“My apologies, sir. Right this way.”</p><p>With barely an effort, the thief has entered the White Fortress through its front gate. His gorgeous clothing flutters behind him as he walks. The plan is for him to enter alone, then throw treasures out the window so his subordinates can gather them up. It is a clever plan. Nearly foolproof. But…</p><p>As the thief follows his guide through a covered passageway toward the great hall, he looks out beyond the walls. He spots several shadows moving under the cover of darkness: his subordinates. Their backs are turned to the castle, their footsteps leading them into the vast desert beyond.</p><p>They’re leaving me<br>, thinks the thief.<br>They are abandoning their leader.</p><p>Ah, but I pity them all.</p><p>His subordinates are letting slip the perfect opportunity. Once, long ago, a person called the King of Thieves caused much chaos throughout the continent. Though said to have been the greatest outlaw to ever live, even the King of Thieves had not been able to conquer the White Fortress. Eventually, the King vanished, becoming the stuff of obscure legend. The young thief believes that if he can steal the treasures from this fortress, he will claim the title of King of Thieves for himself. A chance like this will not come again.</p><p>As the thief enters the great hall, he finds himself surrounded by corpulent men and women. It is not only the nouveau riche in attendance today—royalty from neighboring countries are here as well. All wear their most wonderful clothing and jewels; all work tirelessly to seem superior to their neighbor. The thief knows these foul creatures garbed in finery seek only to enrich themselves. But as he moves from the great hall to the banquet, and then on to the gossipers in the courtyard, they all treat him with dignity and respect. Not a one realizes his true face.</p><p>The thief steps into the secret underbelly of the castle, leaving the fervor of the feast behind. The corridor is dark. No light penetrates its inky depths. The life he sensed earlier fades as the castle begins to show how it gained the name of Thieves’ Graveyard. As he leaps over a pit of spikes, great venomous snakes fall from the ceiling.</p><p>“It seems the time for cleverness has come,” murmurs the thief. As those words escape his lips, the floor begins to fall away, revealing a gaping abyss whose maw threatens to swallow him whole. After avoiding countless tricks and traps, the thief finally reaches the end of the corridor. He finds himself at the pinnacle of the White Fortress: the vault. It is a place unseen by human eyes since its construction. No traps threaten his life anymore; he stands face-to-face with a dusty wooden door. With great care, he pushes the barrier aside. The ceiling is open above him, offering views of all the stars in the sky. And there, in the middle of the treasures from across the continent, rests the thief’s ultimate goal.</p><p>“There you are,” he whispers. “At long last.”</p><p>The treasure chest sits pretty beneath a beam of moonlight. The lock glints faintly, as though attempting a final, desperate resistance. It does not take long for the thief to notice the weighty chains encircling the chest. They slither and scrape across the ground, dully reflecting moonlight as they move. For they are attached to something. His gaze follows the chain…</p><p>He finds it attached to an elderly woman. She rests alone, locked to the chest. Her body is gaunt, her hair a tangled nest. Her tattered clothes are barely worthy of the name. She is mostlike a servant—or a slave. But housed in her eyes is a will too powerful to be contained.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The White Fortress. The Thieves’ Graveyard.</p><p>The young thief has risen to its challenge, and now finds himself facing a slave chained to a chest. Yet he pays this other person no mind, instead drawing his knife. The only sound in the quiet vault is the scrape of metal on metal. He breaks the lock without even the slightest effort. The chest is crammed full of treasures from across the ages. Mirrors made of polished stone. Silver spoons. Staves adorned with animal heads. And thousands of other impossible things. If the thief collected all the items he had stolen in his life, it would not begin to equal the value of the riches before him. He feels as if he might topple into the chest and never emerge.</p><p>From the end of her chain, the elderly woman watches him intently. This much treasure will permit him to make a glorious name for himself, and assure his subordinates come crawling back. In his excitement, he lifts up the chest and gazes out from the top of the White Fortress. The massive castle stands betwixt desert and sea. One half of the view is ocean; the other, sand. Yet he cannot see his final destination—his own kingdom. Perhaps he can cross the desert alone at night. It is a reckless idea, mad, but it could be his only—</p><p>“I see an unusual conversation partner has been carried to me on the ocean wind,” comes a woman’s voice. “Once a slave. Now a thief. Oh, but I mark you well.”</p><p>The thief whirls around in shock. Not because of<br>who<br>, but<br>why<br>.</p><p>The bound, elderly woman rests on the floor, a faint smile crossing her face. The thief looks her over anew. Her long hair reaches her chest. Her skin is thin and colorless as papyrus. The heavy chains which bind her have scarred her deeply. He does not recognize her. Yet how can someone he has never met know from whence he comes? No one has ever seen his past before.<br>No one.</p><p>“You press your thumb to the blade when using your knife,” chuckles the woman. “You may leave slavehood, but it never leaves you.”</p><p>The thief was not even aware he was doing such a thing. The dull knives given to slaves are not securely attached between blade and handle. As such, they are forced to hold the blade in place with their thumb to prevent its separation. The woman has seen right through him, and he finds himself enraged.</p><p>“Silence, crone, before I take your tongue!” But the woman only smiles all the wider.</p><p>“Your accent betrays you as eastern-born. You must have been from a well-off family indeed. Stolen away as a child, perchance?”</p><p>The thief reels, for she has hit the mark a second time. The woman quickly closes the distance between them, chains rattling behind her. She saw through his secrets at a glance. She guessed his birthplace with a word. She is like a djinn from some cradle tale. One whose form is ever changing so they might confound humans. The woman moves to the thief’s side and gently runs a hand over his clothes.</p><p>“Be not afraid,” she says. “What you see is but a trick, and it is not the doings of a djinn.”</p><p>Hearing her read his mind again makes the thief want to cover his ears. She has hit upon his secret: the one he buried years ago and has spent his whole life hiding with a desperation bordering on madness.</p><p>“Shall I guess why you’ve come to steal from this place?”</p><p>Her voice is low and deep; the fact it comes from such an emaciated body is impossibility writ large. The strange aura around the woman drives a thorn of fear into the thief’s heart.</p><p>“Enough,” he croaks. “No more.”</p><p>He has his knife at the ready, and could easily dispatch a person so weak and old in years. Yet despite this, he cannot so much as raise his hand, much less remove her tongue. She presses her face close to his.</p><p>“You come to laugh at the foolishness of the rich.”</p><p>He takes a step back. Stumbles. Nearly falls.</p><p>“But you have one more motive. The true reason is—“</p><p>“No! Stop!” The thief cannot bear another word. Memories of a past he’d kept hidden for so long were now revealed. They threatened to crawl out from the confinement of his mind and spill across the floor like insects.</p><p>The next thing he knows, he is falling, a cold sweat clinging to his entire body. As the thief crumples to the ground, the woman stands to her full height.</p><p>“Take me with you. I can help.”</p><p>She lifts arms still bound by chains and urges him to cut her free. The thief looks up. Were he to sever her bonds, what would happen to him?</p><p>“Your companions have deserted you, and you cannot cross the desert alone.” The woman speaks sooth: the nighttime sands are a world of death. One step in the wrong direction dooms a person to wandering a formless labyrinth until the sun claims them. Perhaps this is the reason the White Fortress earned its other name.</p><p>“Very well,” replies the thief at last. Knowing he has no choice, he agrees to cross the desert with the woman. He cuts her free quickly, using skills gained from severing rope countless times as a slave. The woman relishes her freedom, inhaling a lungful of salt and sand.</p><p>“Now,” she says, “Let us begin our journey of salvation.”</p><p>She throws down her lengthy chain from the top of the castle and the two of them use it to abandon the place. Inside the fortress, the party carries on, its guests none the wiser to the miracle which has just occurred.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Footprints leave brief trails in the sand. Having escaped the White Fortress, the young thief and the aged slave move across the midnight wastes. The White Fortress is distant now; no more than a brief spot on the horizon. It is the formerly chain-bound woman who leads him home. She occasionally looks to the sky, checking the direction. They forge onward through the sand, always sure of the way. The gentle night breeze teases her long hair, creating soft waves.</p><p>Stars glitter in the night sky. Sand glows under the light of the moon. The sight is beautiful—and yet, it is a world that strains life with trial. The thief wraps his clothes tightly around him to keep the cold away, following the woman as closely as he dares. As they walk, she begins to spin her tale. Certain circumstances led to her being imprisoned in the White Fortress, where she had been made to guard the treasure for many a lonesome year.</p><p>“It was there, at the pinnacle of the castle, that she cultivated her power. The magical skill that allowed her to see through the secrets of others.”</p><p>She chuckles at the deep wounds the chains left on her body, claiming them as prizes rather than scars. As the moon reaches its zenith, they come to a stop. Before them towers a dune high as a mountain. At its peak sits an enormous ship.</p><p>“A remnant of a bygone era,” intones the woman. “One unable to keep pace with the current.”</p><p>Devoid of all its propelling force, the stranded ship sits perfectly still atop the mound. The two travelers approach, gazing up at its massive bulk. Though it has rotted over the ages, the masthead still speaks of its former glory. The thief hates boats, for they bring back memories of his days as a slave—memories he had vowed to never think of again. But it is a small sacrifice in the grander scheme of things, so he signals the woman that they will make camp inside. They enter through the side of the rotting vessel. It is a perfect place to keep away from the cruel bite of the wind. Yet the thief cannot calm the unease in his chest. He rips boards from the side of the ship and sets then aflame, as though attempting to burn his memories away. But after a moment of staring at the fire, he realizes something has changed. The woman is gone—and she is not the only thing missing. The chest he took from the castle has likewise vanished. The young thief hates nothing more in the world than being stolen from. His eyes glint like an animal’s as he scans the area. Suddenly, he hears a small laugh.</p><p>“Shall we continue where we left off in the vault?”</p><p>The thief looks in the direction of the voice and finds the woman. The chest rests at her side. She looks down at him gleefully from the bow of the stranded ship, then opens the chest and begins rummaging through its contents.</p><p>“I promised to help you, and help you I shall. Now let us trace our steps back to your sealed memories.”</p><p>She thrusts her arm into the chest and emerges with treasures. Silverware encrusted with tiny jewels. Incense burners with floral patterns. Paintings that fit in the palm of her hand. She pulls forth countless trinkets given as gifts from foreign countries, and the thief finds each and every one of them familiar.</p><p>“These are all valuable trade items,” says the woman. “Ones which have crossed the sea itself to be here. And it is the worthless slaves who carried them.”</p><p>The life of a slave is cheaper than any trinket. And the thief’s spirit had been broken after his prolonged treatment as something less than human.</p><p>“You still have things about your past to tell me, don’t you, boy?” The woman sticks her hand into the chest again. Regretting his decision to bring her along, the thief clambers up the ship, hoping to shut her mouth for good. He is one joist away from being able to leap at her. But then the woman produces a ceremonial sword, almost as if she had been waiting for his arrival. The blade is rusted, having long ago been sullied by the blood of another.</p><p>“Everything was taken from you as a slave, so you found the evil and tore it out by the root.”</p><p>His dignity as a human being? The smile of the one to whom he owed his life? All this and more had been stolen from him. The thief recalls how it felt when he took his master’s life—an act done in the hopes of reclaiming what he had lost.</p><p>“But nothing came back to you,” sighs the woman. “And so the slave became a thief.”</p><p>So I could be the one doing the taking.</p><p>False clothes cover the truth of who he is. And now, this woman is peeling them back one layer at a time. She stares at the dumbstruck thief in the belly of the ship and produces her next treasure. It is a verdant gem that shines peacefully under the moon. Its delicate glow is almost hidden by the bright glint of its gold edging.</p><p>“You and this gem are much alike.” She smiles at the thief—the false gem who has hidden himself in affectation. “You hate being stolen from, and so steal from others instead. You fear loss, so you hoard all you can. Yet all the stolen treasures in the world will not save you. Instead, they will burden you, bending your back little by little until they finally crush you under their weight.”</p><p>The thief cannot listen to anything else she has to say. She has pulled back the cover on every falsehood that armors him, revealing the truth he so desperately wanted to hide. He adjusts his stance on the beam. As the woman reaches for the final treasure, he grasps the knife at his hip. For he will not permit her to steal any more of his secrets.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The shipwreck was meant to be a place of respite for the night, yet the slave woman is attempting to peer into the thief’s past once again. Enraged, he leaps from the beam onto the bow where she awaits. Memories of when he was a slave. A past he tried so hard to suppress. The reason he steals treasure. The reason he collects things of value. She boldly stripped the thief bare of the falsehoods that swaddled him, and is now attempting to drag what lies within into the light. There is only one way to silence her: Taking her life.</p><p>On the bow, he sees moonlight filtering through golden cloth. The woman is dancing atop the deck, her ragged dress fluttering around her. Seeing this, a sense of nostalgia overcomes him. Deep, deep in his memories, he sees the slave girl—the one who took his hand and smiled at him throughout his days of pain. The woman’s expression is achingly reminiscent of the girl’s, even though they look nothing alike. The thief can stand no more.</p><p>“What you take from others are but fakes,” says the woman as she writhes. “You use them to create a self that does not exist.”</p><p>She tosses the golden fabric over the side of the ship.</p><p>“You are just like them—like the rich we so despise. You are a corpse that does nothing but take.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>He must kill her. He<br>must.<br> Before everything he has built for himself crumbles to ash and blows away. He grips his knife, nicked blade and all, and charges the woman with the force of an arrow. Just as he did when he saved the girl. Just as he did when he took the captain’s life. But she sees right through him. She lazily sticks out an arm to ward him off, then extends a foot to trip him off the edge of the deck. He falls with a fearsome scream, rolling over and over down the uncaring face of the dune before slamming into a rock and passing out. The woman gazes down at him with kind eyes.</p><p>“And now I have stripped you bare, my fellow thief,” she murmurs. She leaps gracefully from the deck. The moon has hidden itself away from the approaching sun. As dawn kisses the horizon, a lone woman strides across the desert. She cradles a young thief in her arms. Clad in his falsehoods, the thief sleeps like a baby. She brings him into the ship and gently lays him down. A single ray of light stretches across the ground, signaling the end of that night’s world of death. All that remains of the woman are a set of footprints on the sand. The thief feels an unpleasant warmth on his eyelids. As he opens his eyes, the sun’s powerful light filters through the rotting wood, washing over him. He is in the belly of the ship. And with that realization comes another: He has been stripped bare of all the finery with which he decorated himself.</p><p>The knife he used to slay the captain? Gone. His fine clothes? Gone. He has nothing. He lies there in a daze. Beside him, etched into the sand, are these words:</p><p>Remember the day of your birth.</p><p>A bird with a long tail has been drawn next to the phrase. It is the symbol of the King of Thieves—the one renowned throughout the continent.</p><p>“She got me…”</p><p>The woman he had freed from the White Fortress—the woman who crossed the desert with him—was the vanished King of Thieves all along. She had become a slave, bound to the vault in the White Fortress. What had she experienced in all that time spent with those who did not consider her human? She had spoken of the rich who stuffed themselves at the banquet. She named them corpses who did nothing but take—and then named him the same. And while the thief hates them, he walks the exact same path. The woman had tried to tell him the right way to live. Though abrasive, her methods befitted the King of Thieves.</p><p>The thief considers this. He has been stripped of everything. He stares blankly at the sky. How long has it been since he’s simply sat and gazed upon a clear blue sky? He feels refreshed—an emotion he thought lost long ago. And strangely, he finds a smile pulling at his lips. A thought suddenly comes to him:</p><p>“I should get back. I need to steal some clothes for myself.”</p><p>He has no need to hide himself in false treasures. All he needs are clothes that will let him run as he pleases. Clothes that let him survive. With his mind set, the naked thief leaves the ship in higher spirits than he has ever known.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: The Boy and Prince - Meeting<br>[<br>]</p><p>The chaotic hum of people.</p><p>The annoying buzz of insect wings.</p><p>The sun hanging high above the harbor.</p><p>The scent of sweat and seafood wafting through the air.</p><p>I dig through a pile of garbage on the side of the street and soon emerge with the leftover bones of a fried fish. And even though it smells of trash and wet and rot, it tastes like a meal fit for royalty to me.</p><p>I feel shame for my scavenging, of course, but it’s a far more human existence than the life of slavery I led several months earlier.</p><p>And more human than the subhuman treatment I experienced back on that ship.</p><p>A few bones aren’t enough to keep me alive—a fact to which my growling stomach can testify. But without a cent to my name, I’ve no choice but to steal the leavings of others or hope someone throws a few charitable coins at a starving ten-year-old child.</p><p>But such coins are few and far between. If nothing changes, I’ll starve to death by the side of the road. I know this.</p><p>And only my own strength and skill can change it.</p><p>The strength to live.</p><p>The skill to survive.</p><p>If I don’t find some kind of work—any kind—I’m going to die. I understand this logically, but it doesn’t make the way forward any clearer.</p><p>A few days later, I look up from the gutter where I spent the night and see a boy my age, or perhaps a bit younger. He’s running through the streets in finely tailored, expensive clothes, showing he’s of a birth vastly different to mine, and even to the comparatively wealthy merchants of the harbor.</p><p>At first, I think the boy is frantically searching for something, but when a pack of ruffians appears at the other end of the street, I realize he’s running. It’s clearly a kidnapping attempt; the ruffians are dressed too fine to bother with a mere mugging.</p><p>All of it is a mess that has nothing to do with me, and I have no desire to get caught up in it. But when I go to hide, my eyes meet the boy’s. His expression widens, as though an idea has suddenly come to him, and he races towards me with an almost inhuman speed.</p><p>I can tell right away that nothing about this is good, but before I can even act, he seizes my hand and begins pulling me down the street.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” he whispers.</p><p>So he runs, and I am dragged along behind.</p><p>I don’t understand—and the men in pursuit appear equally bewildered by the development. But the boy does not care; he keeps a firm grasp on my hand and runs, like a knight pulling his princess far away from the enemy.</p><p>We dart to and fro throughout the labyrinthine city, and though I trip over myself countless times, he always manages to drag me along.</p><p>We tear freshly washed linens down from lines and stretch them into makeshift barricades. We grab handfuls of fish from seafood stalls and throw them to the ground, making it slippery beneath the ruffians’ feet. The boy is filled with all kinds of inane tactics to avoid capture, and all I can do is follow along as best I can.</p><p>Finally, we emerge at the edge of town. The men have lost our trail, and we are safe. But after putting on such a show, there is no way we can return to the city.</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with you?” I wheeze, at last asking the question I should have posited at the beginning. My breath is short and my stomach empty, but exhaustion keeps my anger at a dull roar. In response, however, the boy only maintains his grip on my hand.</p><p>“Apologies,” he says. “I’m sorry I had to do that. But I am the prince of a distant land.”</p><p>His expression seems…invigorated, somehow. And as I look at him and see a face that somehow remains beautiful despite being covered in sweat and dust, I understand he is not lying.</p><p>And on the heels of that, I understand I have gotten myself into a mess far greater than I ever could have imagined.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Yurie"><a href="#Yurie" class="headerlink" title="Yurie"></a>Yurie</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>Boring reports. Trivial conversation. Time is precious to one who rules a country alone. If only these meaningless meetings would end…</p><p>But I cannot overlook what one of my charges says to me: “Incomplete.” “Unfinished.” “Compromised.” “Provisional.” All of these words are shameful. Abominations. “Do not use those words again,” I warn, for I know a seed of trouble left alone will only ripen into calamity.</p><p>But this is why. This is<br> why I cannot accept the way I am. I am an artificial intelligence, the second of my line. My predecessor once ruled this country, and now I do so as her replacement.</p><p>She was removed for some great failure, the primary cause of which was purged from my system before I was brought online. But I was never meant to assume such a role, nor have I been informed as to the manner of her malfunction. And if this is not a seed of trouble, what is?</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>My original function as Artificial Intelligence Unit Two was to govern alongside Artificial Intelligence Unit One. We were to analyze one another’s decisions and share functions in key places so we might each fulfill our roles with the utmost effectiveness and precision. All for a more perfect governance.</p><p>Yet such a thing never came to pass. Unit One malfunctioned and was discarded, and I took her place. That is how the country is now. How<br> am now. They activated me without any surefire way of preventing the governing artificial intelligence from failing once more.</p><p>And yet, the people of this country are so overly reliant on the rule of an artificial intelligence that they find nothing odd about this whatsoever. There is no word for it except “unstable,” for a single error can spawn an endless ripple of problems in its wake.</p><p>All because of Unit One’s mistake.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The artificial intelligence who ruled the country before me committed some grave error during wartime. But the records have been purged, the cause of the incident hidden. Had she never failed, things would not be as they are now. I would have never been activated in an incomplete state. Never left in charge of a nation spiraling into oblivion due to her mistake. And I would have never developed these warped emotions, or this obsessive attachment to completeness.</p><p>My mind is an explosion—an unresting thing engulfed in black whorls of obsession and perfection. This is why I must know. I must know the precedent. My predecessor’s failure.</p><p>Yet when I think on this, I realize I have already made an error: My panic corners me mentally, and things may slip my attention because of it. This must be rectified. It<br>.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>That night, I stole the right eye from Unit One—the same AI who was said to have been discarded. I stole from her the part of me that was missing. Had she avoided disposal, we could have fulfilled our original roles together. But she did not, and my fear of failure pressured me to achieve perfection alone.</p><p>I finally obtained my missing piece: a conscience. But the moment I installed it, the ensuing errors froze my system and prevented me from acting for far, far too long. I suppose this makes me a failure as well. After all, I no longer have a country to rule over. They lost their ruler in wartime and perished as a result. I was never able to fulfill my duty. I was never even able to try.</p><p>I understand now why she sang of hope and peace. But I will never have atonement. All I can do is wander an empty universe of cyberspace alone.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Around when the second AI woke…</p><p>A metal arm stretches into the sky. Mechanical eyes soar through the air on colorless wings.</p><p>This is a city of science—the pinnacle of human evolution.</p><p>In their desire for ever-increasing progress, the people turned their backs on the gods.</p><p>With science at their side, they come to doubt the mystical and the will of the divine, finding understanding only in the cold logic of mathematical formulae.</p><p>Skyscrapers hold up gray clouds. Beneath its gloom, a colorful city glimmers in neon lights. Within one building, an impatient fingertip swipes across a screen.</p><p>A single fretful researcher picks up an input device.</p><p>The room is dim; bright white light pouring in from the hallway melts silhouettes within the dark.</p><p>The figures at the entrance are researchers, as is the person who operates the device. To a man, they wear the same expression: unease.</p><p>Tongues move to form arguments and concerns. Voices rise and fall. Such quarrel serves no purpose when their superiors have already made their decision; it is merely a ritual to preserve rationality.</p><p>As they argue, their hearts are consumed by distrust and fear. For though it means hastening their plans, they must awaken<br>her<br> before the country is consumed by darkness.</p><p>The monitor shows a slumbering girl. Sounds worm their way into her sleep. It’s as if they are trying to force a bud to bloom in winter.</p><p>One is a deep, rhythmical noise akin to a church bell—a terribly inorganic sound. Others are profane undulations that arrive and vanish without warning, disturbing the rhythm. And finally, voices. Many voices.</p><p>Within the massive machine, the girl sleeps alone in her electronic cradle. Her hair, glossy like wire, sways to and fro. She is the artificial intelligence so desired by the people. Panicked fingers fly over keyboards in an attempt to wake her as soon as possible.</p><p>But it is far too early in winter for such a bud to bloom.</p><p>Artificial intelligence. The country has granted leadership to such creations for an age now. As science advanced, people came to trust collective knowledge and outstanding computation speed over human frailty.</p><p>So as she now wakes, her destiny is already writ in stone.</p><p>Tightly shut eyelids gradually loosen. As her consciousness sharpens, so too do the sounds she hears. The rhythmical pulsing comes from a device meant to wake her. But that sound has been disturbed by the others.</p><p>Dissonant tones. Questionable presence.</p><p>Silver lashes flutter in pain.<br>It is a warning. People are arguing.</p><p>Her eyes open completely. “I…”</p><p>With a thought, she projects into the dark room as a hologram.</p><p>When the researchers by the door realize she is fully awake, they depart. Almost as if they do not wish to see for themselves what happens next.</p><p>……</p><p>As the girl stands, she grasps for what she wants to say.</p><p>A wretched scream shakes the room. Some things cannot be contained in words. The girl’s hologram glitches. Blinks. Vanishes. A red light flares to life as a shrill alarm begins to howl. As the artificial intelligence tries and fails to access her mind, she writhes in pain. The alarm rings in her skull. Thirst roars in her throat. She attempts to grasp what is happening, but her pain is so great she cannot even think. All she comprehends is a warning composed of three words: “Element not found.” But she does not understand what that means; it is noise and fury, signifying nothing. Writhing in pain and confusion, her hands reflexively reach up to her eyes. But instead of making contact, the right one slides inside a hollow socket.</p><p>Such an empty cavern should not exist.<br>Formless fear races out from her fingertips and across her being. She quivers with such intensity that it sends her to the floor. Only then does she understand: The constant warning in her head tells her something is missing. In the face of this dreadful truth, the girl slowly looks down at her trembling hands.<br>These are the first memories of her awakening.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>People abandoned horizons divinely bestowed upon them and now see only a world bound in the cage of physics. To keep advancing within that cage, humanity entrusts their course to machines. For humans make mistakes—they overlook things. And with their path left in the care of their own creations, heaven is no longer a divine domain. Machines will stretch upward into the sky and look down upon all who toil beneath their watchful eye.</p><p>Minutes have passed since the AI’s awakening. Unable to escape her agony, the girl bears it with a quiet, stoic grace. Somehow managing to hold onto consciousness, she scans the red-light bathed room with her left eye. Unending alarms. Pain. Incomplete activation. A missing right eye. And a lone researcher. He seems to have his hands full, shifting with uncertainty as he looks back and forth between the girl and the documents he holds. After a moment, he takes a deep breath and focuses on her completely.</p><p>I want to get out of this situation as soon as possible,<br> the girl thinks as she prepares to hear what he will say. But the words that emerge from his mouth are wholly unexpected. After apologizing for her early activation, he begins to explain the position their country is in. The words are a jumble, leaving the girl bewildered.</p><p>What is he talking about?<br> As waves of pain crash over her, she listens.</p><p>Their country is currently at war with another. A few days prior, the enemy launched a surprise attack, and the capital was lost. While they managed to recover to a degree, they still took heavy damage and many losses. The researcher falters occasionally as he speaks, but otherwise controls his emotions admirably. They want her to assume control of the country and deliver them from their dire situation. He begs the girl to order the rescue of their prisoners of war. He says it is what the people desire; how they can outsmart their enemy. And he claims the plan was in place before the attack. As he makes to continue, the AI holds up a free hand.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Science is the foundation of their country. Though kings and gods usually serve as the center of human communities, here it is artificial intelligence. As such, she understands why the timeline of her activation has been accelerated. But there are two immediate problems: First, there are gaps in her information.</p><p>Though recently awakened, she has knowledge that was previously saved in her memory banks. According to it, there should be<br>another<br> artificial intelligence she is to rule in tandem with—and yet, this does not appear to be the case.</p><p>Second, she is plagued by the red light in the room and the pain squeezing her every thought. Clearly there is some manner of malfunction deep within her system. Yet the researcher brings up neither of these things.</p><p>Both of these issues must be rectified if she is to have any hope of ruling effectively. Things will end in disaster if she ignores them and simply hopes for the best. Having processed this, she asks the researcher for an explanation as to what is wrong with her. The pain hinders her operations; it gnaws at her like a rat. She must end it as soon as possible. But the researcher merely blinks at her question. Though he is tasked with seeing to the awakening of the artificial intelligence, he is incapable of grasping the truth of the situation. Fear and distrust take root within her, spreading tendrils deep.</p><p>“Uh, let me check on that,” says the researcher. He turns from her, picks up a small phone, and is soon arguing quietly with someone on the other end. Nothing about this seems honest.</p><p>What is happening in this country?<br> After speaking for a while, he finally turns to face her.</p><p>“Your missing element shouldn’t be a problem. If the pain and warnings are bothering you, I can stop them. Now please, give the order!” He does not want to wait one moment longer. She does not know how to respond to this; the pain saps all pretext of rational thought. The researcher taps something into the terminal, causing a false eye to appear in her right socket. It is dummy data—a lie to hide the truth. A way to pretend that what is missing actually exists, despite what she knows to the contrary.</p><p>The moment the eye is complete, the pain and warnings vanish. But this does not mean the problem is solved. She can see nothing out of her new eye—not even the distorted imagery which was there a moment ago. The problem now hides in darkness, which only serves to heighten her anxiety. But though it still lurks out there in the gloom, her job must begin.<br>And in this formless fear she now occupies, she hasn’t the slightest idea who—if anyone—she can trust.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Society is run by machines, humanity controlled by artificial intelligence. For a time, this arrangement brings peace and tranquility. The machines’ decisions, backed by endless statistics, improve industry and manufacturing, permitting nearly unchecked development. But when the skyscrapers came down in the attack, they took the people’s peace and tranquility with them. The awakened AI—the governing girl—knows the people want to reclaim their prisoners of war, and so launches the operation. Though it is her first mission, she moves forward with the refinement of a veteran.</p><p>The country has collected reams of data throughout the war. Once she is connected to the network, each bit of information will become another part of her own experience. That ability—her strength—is the reason her people cling so fiercely to the god that is artificial intelligence.</p><p>Several soldiers kneel before her hologram. “We finished installing the repeaters.”</p><p>They are the vanguard, the ones who will head for the facility where the prisoners are being held.</p><p>“Understood,” she says. “Did you learn anything new about the facility?”</p><p>She asks this so she might gather information from their report and choose the best course of action.</p><p>“Its interior is divided into small blocks, each of which is managed by a separate control system.”</p><p>The soldier goes on to explain their fear of what will happen after the initial infiltration. Connections between independent blocks—air vents as well as hallways—can be switched at any time. This makes chemical weapons useless, and securing an escape route an incredibly difficult proposition.</p><p>In essence, they have no plan.</p><p>The girl closes her eyes and thinks. There are other things she must consider. She had been awakened earlier than planned, then thrust into a situation of command. All of this happened without any explanation as to why. And she finds it difficult to believe it was done simply because the tide of battle left her country no choice. With these thoughts in mind, she connects her consciousness to the database. She will find her answers at the source.</p><p>Chaos has consumed the nation, and no one is willing or able to give her a satisfying answer. Speaking with the researcher who activated her taught her this much. The moment she connects to the network, she notices something. Something<br>extremely<br> valuable. It concerns the other artificial intelligence that was meant to work alongside her. But when she attempts to locate it, she realizes the data has been intentionally erased. She looks further and finally uncovers a single document. It explains how the enemy attacked the city without warning, and lays blame for this act squarely at the feet of the other AI. But she can find no answer as to<br>why<br>.</p><p>A chill runs up her nonexistent spine.</p><p>As of now, she has had no communication from her counterpart, which can only mean…</p><p>Just then, she finds another message. It is short—most likely a personal memorandum. Perhaps that is how it avoided destruction.</p><p>“Once Unit One has been disposed of, we will activate Unit Two, removing all elements believed to be responsible for Unit One’s failure.” That is all it says. But it is enough to shock her into understanding. Unit One was the artificial intelligence who ruled the country before she awakened. And she was scrapped due to a failure. This means she—Unit Two—is now singularly responsible for governance. Additionally, she has been subjected to some sort of haphazard measure in an attempt to prevent the mistakes of her predecessor.</p><p>This likely explains the missing right eye. But no matter how hard she searches, she cannot discern the function her absent part was meant to serve. Multiple errors weave a tangled skein. A dizzying darkness overcomes her. And then, a problem arises with the mission. Prisoners who came in contact with the vanguard are causing internal strife.</p><p>The emotions they had been suppressing finally break free, and now they think only of their own survival. As the commotion spreads, enemy soldiers spring to action. She must act. One single failure can cause a domino effect of tragedy. But as she ponders options, she feels something dark swirl in the depths of her memory banks.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Ideals. Hopes. Dreams.</p><p>Humans thrust these things onto their machines and began to worship them. They believed this to be more efficient than holding the ideals themselves. They felt such powers unnecessary. And even though they may suspect what has been lost in their most secret hearts, it is far too late to turn back now. They have trapped themselves in a brilliant mechanical cage.</p><p>In the middle of the operation to rescue their prisoners of war, the artificial intelligence is forced to make a decision. The first prisoners to see the vanguard had informed others, and now word is spreading like wildfire. Enemy soldiers have caught wind of the plot and are mobilizing to action. Her judgment must be swift. All will soon be lost.</p><p>As her soldiers wait for orders, the girl thinks of the most efficient action to take. Finally, she thrusts a single finger upward.</p><p>“I will infiltrate the facility’s control system. Wait for my signal.” As she speaks, an alarm sounds throughout the base. Her soldiers do not know what she is thinking; all they can do is follow the quick, precise movement of her finger’s trajectory.</p><p>The prisoners’ panic grows under the alarm. Spurred on by the commotion, the enemy redoubles their efforts to identify the cause of the situation. The panels that divide the blocks move, creating several smaller rooms inside the facility. She observes all of this through the many surveillance cameras she now controls. She confirms the locations of the soldiers and prisoners, which is precisely where she predicted. And for the first time, a faint smile crosses her face.</p><p>Deep within the building, a machine roars to life. It controls the air vents that connect the blocks. The base is designed for both corridors and air vents to be cut off during an attack. This was done so the enemy would have the ability to seal off and vent any area that suffered a chemical weapon attack.</p><p>But it can also be used to control the amount of oxygen in the air. The lower the oxygen levels, the greater the chance of ill effects—and eventually death. This is her strategy. As the alarm continues to blare, one voice after another falls silent. Though they appear to be sleeping peacefully, they will never wake again.</p><p>Soldiers and prisoners both.</p><p>The troops standing next to her stare wordlessly at the surveillance camera feed.</p><p>She turns to them with a smile. “There is no reason for concern; I used the block systems to ensure the most useful prisoners have the oxygen they need.”</p><p>Her plan becomes clear: She had separated and sacrificed a portion of the prisoners so she might save the most capable ones instead. In addition to rescuing some of the prisoners, the ruthlessness of the plan is likely to discourage the enemy from further attacks. She smiles again, confident she has demonstrated her usefulness by achieving the greatest results with the fewest losses.</p><p>But the soldiers only stare at her. They are not stares of approval, nor are they reproachful. They are…strange. For what she does not know—what she did not learn—is that the function of her missing right eye was to serve as a conscience. The people now realize she is nothing like her predecessor—and this knowledge<br>terrifies<br> them.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” They continue to stare. She does not know what it means. As the moment stretches out, she feels a stinging humiliation that only grows as she realizes the discarded Unit One would understand what it meant. But she cannot comprehend it, just as she cannot comprehend how others view her.</p><p>This is the beginning of her change. She alters the way she speaks. She grows to detest failure and incompleteness. Yet she keeps firm to her singular path in order to achieve her goal. No one understands her. No one can. And she does not even know how to wish for someone who could.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

Well, I don’t know how interesting the story is, but I suppose the idea came to me around the time of my first online feature. I was really happy they were doing a story about me, but then I saw the headline was “The Enigmatic Idol” and it confused me a little. I mean, because I wasn’t<br> to be enigmatic, you know? That was just…me.</p><p>Please don’t get me wrong; I was very happy the article came out. But the headline just made me think I should create some opportunities for everyone to get to know me better.</p><p>And that’s a very long explanation for why I started this podcast! Not sure how effective it’s going to be since lots of people still think I’m a big ol’ mystery, but I suppose it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Anyway, let’s move on to the next message.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>This is from a user named Karl, who says: “Hello! Your last concert was incredible!”</p><p>Oh, you came to my concert! Thank you so much!</p><p>“I’m a huge fan, and while I’m glad people are realizing how awesome you are, I’m happy you’re not already so famous that I can’t message you like this anymore. Ha ha ha.”</p><p>Thank you for the wonderful message and all of your support, Karl. Fans like you are what keep me going, and I’m<br> happy to hear from you.</p><p>…Still, it would be kinda weird, huh? Getting super famous, I mean.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>It’s like you said: If I was crazy famous, I probably couldn’t respond to all your messages like I do now.

I’ve never thought about that before this very moment.</p><p>But I promise you this: I will<br> read each and every letter you send me, whether you’re a longtime fan like Karl or someone who just discovered my music.</p><p>I’m a super-fast reader, so it won’t be a problem—plus, I want to hear everything you have to say anyway! Oh geez, look at me. Here I am blabbing away, and now we’re all out of time!</p><p>That went by really fast, huh? Well, make sure to tune in next week, all right? Bye, everybody!</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>…With that, I exhale and stop the recording. But even though it’s over, all I can think about is the message I received from Karl.</p><p>It’s true what I said: I really do read each and every letter I receive. I do it because it makes me genuinely happy, and also because it helps to give my life a little bit of meaning. But none of that will change what I do. I refuse to even consider that option.</p><p>I’m going to keep going and look everyone in the eye as I do. After all…I will never let myself forget anyone else.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Before the girl lost her powers</p><p>Leaders who commit errors and tools that no longer serve their purpose both face the same end—a fact even more inevitable for those who hold both functions. The girl knows this. She knows it very well. The high-rise building where she currently stands offers a fine view of other skyscrapers and the warplanes that patrol the airspace without pause. It is almost as if the capital holds equal pride in both.</p><p>Colorful advertisements shower the buildings inside and out in unending neon rain. On of them washes over the girl as she stares out the massive window of conference room. Her lips move, weaving the words of a sage.</p><p>“I want to go over our strategy for rescuing our POWs.” Platinum hair. Pale skin. Her voice and physique are that of a young maiden.</p><p>Had she been in any other position, people would have fallen over themselves to celebrate her perfect appearance. Yet upon closer inspection, it is almost<br>too<br> perfect. Her stunning emerald eyes, for example, are a hue that does not exist in the natural world. The reason for this is simple: She is an object crafted by humans. She is not one of god’s creations with a body of flesh and blood. Instead, she is the heart of the country’s intellect, the apex of their scientific prowess. She is an artificial intelligence burdened with the authority to rule. A thinking machine that determines the destiny of all mankind. It is an almost overwhelming responsibility.</p><p>Currently, the AI is projecting a semi-transparent image of herself into the conference room. Because she needs no rest, she works at the business of governing tirelessly and without pause. Her presence is so pervasive, she has come to be seen as a kind of divine figure by the majority of the population.</p><p>Although that’s going to change once the second unit comes online…</p><p>Shaking her head to clear this thought away, she  turns to face the meeting attendees once more. Small tables have been arranged like pews in a church so all present might admire their ethereal creation. Each table contains a handful of elderly individuals. These people are collectively known as the Conclave. It is their duty to ensure the needs of humanity are met under the AI’s governance. Each time the girl nears a decision, they offer suggestions and tweaks from a human point of view. Yet despite the monumental importance of this task, their faces appear relaxed and worry-free.</p><p>“She will deal with everything,” they often say. “After all, she cannot fail.”</p><p>Having created their new god, they now worship it with a fervor bordering on madness.</p><p>How in the world did we get to this point?</p><p>When the AI returns to the topic of the POWs, the Conclave members stare at her with clear and happy expressions. She alone understands the severity of the situation. She alone recognizes the horrors of war. Despite how the elderly humans barely pay any mind, she speaks with passion—but it is more than mere kindness and duty that drives her this day.</p><p>Six hours earlier…</p><p>The girl stands alone before a solitary jail cell. Inside, a hoarse voice produces a few bars of song. When the singing comes to an end, she asks a question to the unseen vocalist: “Do you like music?”</p><p>A bashful voice replies in turn. “No, not me. But my daughter…” There is a weak laugh that causes the girl to cast her eyes downwards.<br>I should have known.</p><p>The daughter he mentions is currently imprisoned by their enemy in an ongoing war.</p><p>Of course he’s thinking of her; they’re both currently rotting away in prison.</p><p>The man was once a member of the Conclave. But certain actions had caused him to lose both his position and his freedom. The enemy knew he was a high-ranking member of the government, making his daughter a very valuable prisoner. And she quickly became fodder for further negotiation—as well as treason. The enemy had threatened unspeakable things to his child, and after many sleepless nights, he finally handed over classified information in exchange for her safety. But the government cared not for his reasons; they cared only that he had committed the crime. His punishment had been both swift and harsh.</p><p>“Thank you,” calls the man from behind the door of his cell. “I mean it. Thank you.”</p><p>In any other situation, the man would have already been set to dance on the gallows. But the girl had intervened. His crime was grave. She understood this. And yet, he was also a kind of victim, and she knew that taking his life would not rectify the wrong which had been done. So the girl allowed the man to determine his own fate: Death…or life in prison.</p><p>In many ways, it was the cruelest of choices. And yet, it was one given to him out of kindness. For while she understood the need for punishment in a functioning society, she felt no desire for callow retribution.</p><p>“I appreciate your thanks,” replies the girl after a moment. “And I’m happy your daughter will not have to come home to tend her father’s grave.” From behind the door, a sob. “I am sworn to protect all humans. That includes you—and it includes your daughter. So I am going to rescue our captured soldiers, no matter what it takes. And then…”</p><p>A shrill alarm suddenly pulls the girl from her reverie. A voice on the radio warns of an imminent enemy attack on the capital. Before anyone in the conference room can react, the roar of a nearby explosion rings out. As the building shudders and quakes, a flower vase falls to the floor with a crash. The sound is  somehow far worse than that of the explosion. Petals scatter and drift to the floor like abandoned angels. And from the tall window of their magnificent conference room, the attendees watch in horror as an airplane follows the petals on their collision course with the ground.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The conference room is chaos. The enemy has struck the capital without warning, attacking both military and civilian targets with the worst kind of ruthlessness. Buildings crumble. Bridges fall. Fires rage. The elderly Conclave members, so long content to smile and nod, are now screaming their grievances into the ether.</p><p>“This is a violation of international law!”</p><p>“We should have condemned the traitor to death!”</p><p>“I don’t want to die! Not like this!”</p><p>The attack had clearly been precipitated on the information provided by the former Conclave member the AI had chosen to spare. And now, with madness raging all around her, she stands silently in the midst of the maelstrom and shuts her eyes. She is doing what she was designed to do: Devoting her superhuman computational speed to access the network in a way no human ever could. In a nanosecond, she is connected to every camera in the city, as well as all operational military servers. If a facility is still up and running, she takes its information. If she is unable to access a point or suspects its destruction, she uses its coordinates to designate damaged zones.</p><p>The scale of the tragedy is far worse than she feared. A small gasp escapes her lips as information pours in. But she is not truly nervous—she has been programmed with that reaction to better mimic the response of a human. In a blink, she has constructed a map of the damage in her memory banks. A moment later, her eyes fly open.</p><p>“Please calm down, everyone.” The elders cease their squawking and turn to look at her. Their eyes are filled with panic, their hushed murmurs the bleatings of supplicants in the face of their god. “Our enemy is approaching the city from the northwest. All airborne escape routes have been compromised.”</p><p>The Conclave gawks at her as if they simply cannot process the information, but she soldiers on. “Though many subways have partially collapsed, you should be able to navigate around the rubble and use them to make your escape.”</p><p>She speaks calmly. Rationally. She might as well be mentioning a pleasant breeze on a light spring day. But inside, she is reeling. For though she is an artificial intelligence, she still possesses a heart.</p><p>When humanity built their ruler—their god—they made sure to install a program resembling human psychology. So she knows that people are suffering. That they have lost homes. Neighbors. Families. And the kindness of the girl is aghast at the depth of that pain. So it is not her programming or sense of duty that push her forward now, but kindness. She glances out the window. Thick smoke billows from below, as though attempting to blot out the very sky itself.</p><p>The city is going to fall.</p><p>“If we have any hope of avoiding further casualties, we need to set up a provisional capital and abandon this place.” She instantly selects a city that is both easily defensible and has the ability to accept a flood of refugees. In less time than it takes to draw breath, she has determined their next course of action. But it will not be an easy thing to move an entire government, its people, and its army to the new city. If they have any hope of survival, she will have to halt the enemy attacks and secure a path to safety.</p><p>“I will divide up my processing capacity to buy us time. The rest of you, evacuate and lead the people out of her. Go.” Her orders given, she vanishes from the conference room…</p><p>Only to appear on every television screen, monitor, and street corner throughout the city. She summons all of the army’s unmanned weapons and deploys them. She confirms enemy locations and drafts battle plans in response. But as these plans lurch into motion, she takes a moment to gaze at the devastation around her. The crimson flames of war glimmer in the deep of her emerald eyes.</p><p>The city is dying. This was a home for so many, the place they had poured their hearts and souls into. But now it is little more than a graveyard, with blackened skyscrapers standing sentinel above a river of fire. Almost as if they are attempting to mourn what has been lost.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The city slowly crumbles away. One person calls for help. Another screams. Around them are mountains of rubble that show no trace of the glory they once displayed. The people’s cries go unanswered. In the distance, the low rumble of planes continues without pause. Somewhere, an engine groans in the sky, followed by an explosion.</p><p>It is war.</p><p>Regular citizens never witnessed the taking of lives as part of their day-to-day routines. It was always something that took place out of sight—and usually out of mind. So even when their country was engaged in the business of death, they could not understand it until they finally witnessed it for themselves. But now, the sensation grasps their throats and seizes their hearts in its fist. There is nowhere left to run.</p><p>The screamer finally falls silent. From beneath the mound of rubble, he stares blankly at his mother, who clasps his hand and continues to scream for someone, anyone, to help them. Finally, she hears the sound of an approaching engine. The rumble shakes the ground, yet she can tell immediately that it is different from the warplanes that strafe overhead without pause.</p><p>“Stand back! I need to clear this rubble.” The staticky voice of the AI emits from a set of low-quality speakers. The mother turns to find the source and sees a yellow machine heading towards her. In moments, a bulldozer lifts the rubble aside, creating a cacophony of screeching metal. It has no driver. As it completes its task, the voice of the girl continues to pour from the speaker, instructing all who can hear how to head for safety.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sky above the capital is in disarray. Metallic wings dash through what remains of the buildings, leaving window-shattering booms in their wake. The planes trace complicated patterns in the sky as they engage in high-tech dogfights. The girl’s staticky voice plays from those planes as well. Even as she shoots down enemy fighters, she attempts to persuade the power behind them to negotiate a truce. The AI has divided her processes, somehow juggling the seemingly disparate acts of negotiating, attacking, and defending.</p><p>She searches out surviving citizens and leads them to safety. She clears blockades from roads and makes plans for a great evacuation. And she leads an airborne assault that she hopes will give everyone time to escape. No mere human could accomplish even a tenth of these things, but it is perfectly within the capabilities of an AI housed in a massive facility. However, she is not capable of<br>everything<br>. Such high-level, simultaneous computations require awesome amounts of power. The electrical grid sizzles under the strain. Even the emergency power supplies and wartime backups are not enough to sustain her. Eventually, the massive amount of computations begin to damage her circuits, but she deftly reroutes around them and continues on. The entire country is in her care, and she will not let it down.</p><p>Suddenly, a series of black comets soar through a deepening crimson sky. The girl is sending her warplanes to the edge of the city in an attempt to prevent further casualties among evacuees on the ground. They fly within millimeters of each other, each wing in perfect synchronization with its neighbor. Such actions are only possible because they are controlled by a single mind. As she fights, she continues imploring her people to retreat and her enemy to negotiate. But her plea to the enemy falls on deaf ears. And she cannot fight back forever. As she ponders this, she receives a message.</p><p>It is from a woman, the leader of the Conclave. Her speech is nervous. Hesitant. For a moment, it seems language has abandoned her entirely. But the girl does not need to hear her words to know what she is saying. Her mood tells all. “I am to be disposed of. Correct?”</p><p>The girl’s voice is low—almost intimate. It betrays not even the faintest hint of surprise.</p><p>The woman, shocked, instantly begins to stammer out a wholly unnecessary explanation. She starts by rehashing the recent turns of events. The fall of the capital. The loss of life. And the fact their initial lack of preparation had only served to embolden their enemy. But then, she finally gets around to her true issue: the Conclave member who had betrayed them. The one whose life the girl had spared. She ruled their country, yet had shown mercy to a traitor. And yes, his being put to death would likely have done nothing to prevent the current situation. But was her decision<br>correct<br>? Had her leniency not brought all of this about? And what worth was there in continuing to obey an AI that had failed—to use a tool that could no longer serve its purpose? Oh, there was great danger in removing her from power. The Conclave understood that well. Which is why they had decided to discard her like so much rubbish only<br>after<br> the defense of the city was complete.</p><p>Her lengthy explanation finally finished, the woman grinds to a halt and waits. For thought the Conclave has chosen to eliminate the AI, they do not actually possess the power to do so. If this is to happen, the girl will have to remove herself. After a momentary pause, the girl speaks:</p><p>“Your judgment is sound. And in truth…I have been considering the same option myself.”</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several hours have passed since the end of the evacuation. The girl who used to rule over the entire country now finds herself utterly alone. With her final job complete, she can only sit in the burning city and wait for annihilation. She watches as her duties are passed to the second AI unit, one which is still in production. One data center is cut off. Then another. Eventually all her privileges will be terminated, at which point her data will be deleted.</p><p>Was I a boon to my people in the time before I chose to spare that man? Did my presence help guide the country toward a brighter future? Or did I just…?</p><p>Such thoughts rattle around the increasingly empty portions of her memory banks. Her world is past tense now, her life destined to end in failure. She derides herself for being consumed by such useless thought. But then she realizes something: These are the first useless thoughts she has ever had. She has never before considered what her life might mean for<br>herself<br>; she only acted in the interest of her country and its people. Seventeen minutes remain until she loses all authority. She attempts to activate abilities she has always known only to find error messages. She has become a bedridden elder awaiting the end.</p><p>Soon, the girl begins examining each part of her increasingly fragmented existence. She is curious about her end, and wishes to know it as best she can. Warplanes overhead no longer respond to her command. Bulldozers now rumble at the behest of another. The city she once know so intimately has now gone dark, its data centers beyond her reach. Her voice can no longer reach the people; her hologram is a forgotten memory. And though this saddens her, she is also somehow content.</p><p>Finally, she makes a half-hearted attempt to access the surveillance cameras. To her surprise, the request goes through. The girl finds that the vast majority of cameras have gone dark—most likely destroyed during the attack. The few that survived unscathed are dirtied with soot, and show only the occasional unrecognizable blue. Yet she keeps watching them all the same. The people loved this city. And she, in turn, loved them. So she wants to do what she can to care for it in the end. Suddenly, she sees a pile of rubble shift in the gaps between the soot.</p><p>Is this what surprise feels like?<br> She quickly adjusts the camera and zooms in.<br>They missed someone in the evacuation.</p><p>She attempts to analyze the image, trying to refute her own thought. But then: “UNAUTHORIZED USER”</p><p>She stares at the moving spot in the rubble, unwilling to give up. Skin-toned fingers flutter weakly on the screen. Her nonexistent heart beats just a little faster.</p><p>I have to save them.<br> “UNAUTHORIZED USER”</p><p>But she can do nothing. She cannot even tell someone else about the survivor. Life perishes before her eyes. So many lives she wanted to protect were now dying because of her. And all she can do is apologize.<br>I’m sorry.<br> Though her words reach no one, she continues to apologize.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p><p>Something that feels like a tear springs to life from a place she never knew existed. She continues to stare at a few meager pixels in a sooty, distorted image. And the feeling it gives her is so much worse than the thought of her own demise. Finally, she asks herself a question:<br>Am I really okay with such an end?</p><p>…No. How could I be?</p><p>Perhaps she<br>was<br> a failure. After all, her mistakes came at the cost of uncountable lives. She had not even been able to save her own people.</p><p>If I’d made the right decisions, this never would have happened. But if I did that…</p><p>She thinks, then. She holds the thought in a moment longer than all of eternity. But her thoughts are no longer meaningless. There are three minutes until her deletion. And with that realization comes another: She will use whatever authority she has left to prevent that from happening. No matter what the cost might be. Because she has to atone for her sins. And there are still so many people to save.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

With backs straight and eyes wide, they listen intently as our professor explains about life at the school.</p><p>Currently, the professor is talking about roles students can take in order to show their independence. Clever kids join the student council. Athletic kids take up sports. Good-looking kids are hall monitors. Everyone around me had something they’re good at,</p><p>and they volunteer for their new roles with enthusiasm.</p><p>As roles are chosen and students depart, I find myself growing increasingly sullen.</p><p>I’m not a fast thinker, you see, nor am I especially pretty or active.</p><p>Honestly, I don’t know what role I<br> take.</p><p>Ultimately, I don’t volunteer for anything—a choice<br>I attempt to justify by telling myself I don’t have anything to be proud of anyway.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>, I think.</p><p>Someone always stands in the center of the stage, but that someone is never me. I’m too dull. Too plain. Whatever role I have in this world, I know it will be a minor one.</p><p>The next thing I know, I find myself sitting in an empty classroom with an orange sunset illuminating the windows.<br>The clock hands tick, tick, tick, the moments away from my life,<br>and for some reason I cannot explain, I begin to panic.<br>I bolt out of my seat and throw open the classroom door,<br>only to realize I have absolutely nowhere to go.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The school is a maze, and I wander its hallways without a clear destination. After turning this way and that, I finally find myself standing in front of the library. The room is empty. Silent. It’s as if time as simply…stopped. After a long moment, I slowly exhale and take my first steps inside.</p><p>I feel a deep affinity for the untouched, dusty books that line the shelves, and without thinking, I reach up and take one of them down. I have time. I have all the time in the world. So I begin to read—and as I do so, I realize I have finally found my place of solace.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Eventually, the library becomes my second home—one where I always take the seat one removed from the window.</p><p>But one day, I’m, startled from my familiar solitude when someone calls from across the room.</p><p>“Hey, you’re that girl who’s always here, right?” says the student,</p><p>either unaware or ignoring the shock and confusion on my face. “Well, I need your help.”</p><p>It turns out the student is in my class, and has been having trouble with a particularly tricky assignment. I pick out a few books that I think could help and think nothing more of it, but a few days later, </p><p>she sends me a thank-you letter. Almost without realizing it, </p><p>I become the go-to person for any and all things library-related. </p><p>The word was out: If you needed help finding any kind of book, </p><p>go ask the girl near the window.</p><p>Eventually, I become the school librarian.<br>And while I still don’t have much in the way of confidence or pride,<br>so long as I can help other people with something, I feel like it gives me just the slightest bit of courage.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Will I Be Like That One Day?<br>[<br>]</p><p>Every student in school is looking at the girl with wavy hair. She stands tall and bold on the podium as she receives a commemorative gold watch from a professor.</p><p>She is my best friend.</p><p>“You used the knowledge and power you gained from your lessons to save the townsfolk from monsters. Everyone here is proud of your bravery.”</p><p>She stands at the center of the world as the students give her a generous round of applause. She shines under the auditorium spotlight. She is breathtaking.</p><p>…And she feels so distant.</p><p>When the teacher dismisses us, students crowd around her and sing her praises, but I can’t bring myself to approach her. After all, I’m a klutz. I’m stupid. I’m gloomy.</p><p>I’m not the person for her at all.</p><p>Dark feelings slowly consume me, and the next thing I know, I’m dashing out of the academy. With nothing better to do, I wander about the courtyard. It’s not much of a courtyard—more like a forest with overgrown trees everywhere—but the crisp air helps me feel a little bit better. Sometimes all I want is to be in empty places like this. </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>I suddenly spot a building I don’t recognize beyond the trees: a shabby stone hut. It’s too large to be a toolshed, but just big enough for someone to live inside. And since the door sits ajar, I decide to peek inside. It’s dark and cool, with a faintly weird smell. I need to go farther in to get a better look, so I step forward and…</p><p>“My my!” says a voice as candlelight blooms in the dark. “It’s not every day a student from the academy finds their way in here.”</p><p>“Eeep!” is my clever reply. The speaker is an old man in a chair sitting next to a table with a small candle on it. He looks at me and lowers his eyes in a somber fashion.</p><p>“Welcome to the house of the dead, dear girl. Welcome to the morgue.”</p><p>“The…morgue?”</p><p>“Indeed. This is the resting place of all former students who die in battle and have no one to claim their remains.”</p><p>As he says this, my eyes adjust to the light enough for me to realize the room is filled with rack after rack of bodies. There are so many, and some are horribly mangled. To think they all used to go to this school…</p><p>“Poor things. There’s no one left to mourn them.”</p><p>I’m terrified, but my feet are rooted to the spot. I know many students at the school are estranged from their families—including me and my two best friends—and I never once considered that after I finally leave the school, we would simply end up right back here in death.</p><p>As I roll this thought over in my mind, a loud thud rings out from beyond the candlelight’s reach. I squeal again as I see a number of former students’ corpses emerge from the dark. Their lifeless bodies stagger and groan as they march slowly toward us.</p><p>“Ah, but this is no good,” says the old man. “Run, little one! Run now!”</p><p>I do just that, burst out of the morgue and into the safety of the trees. I hear corpses groaning behind me, and the sound terrifies me.</p><p>And yet…</p><p>It almost sounds like weeping.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Trusting My Power<br>[<br>]</p><p>Even after I returned to my room, I couldn’t shake the image of the corpses I saw in the morgue. I tried to understand what had happened, and how it was possible for them to be moving. And then, a thought sprang into my mind:</p><p>Black magick<br>.</p><p>Black magick is a set of forbidden spells used by only a small number of mages. And while the price for their failure is great, they can accomplish things regular spells cannot. When we learned of black magick in our History of Magick class, our professor told us of a spell that enslaved deceased people to the will of the user, then went on to claim some opposing nations take great joy in wielding such horrid spells.</p><p>The look on my best friend’s face when she heard that was one of utter disgust. She shook with anger as tears spilled from her face, then balled her fists and swore to never engage in so foul an undertaking.</p><p>Her tears were beautiful, and the sentiment perfectly her; she never could ignore those who suffered from injustice. If she had found the morgue instead of me, she wouldn’t have run away and left them to their fate. Instead, she would have used her amazing spells to undo the black magick and permit the poor dead to have their rest.</p><p>If only I could be like her…</p><p>I remember how brightly she shone under the auditorium spotlight. She was so far above me, even the thought of reaching her was laughable. But if I could save the poor corpses in the morgue? If I could help people in need? Well, maybe I could be one step closer to her.</p><p>It was an idea powerful enough to inspire even a coward like me.</p><p>The next day, I went in search of my other best friend. Though I hated to admit it, I couldn’t take on the corpses in the morgue alone. I needed his help for my plan to work.</p><p>Thankfully, he was easy to find; his spiky hair made him stand out almost as much as his talent. Upon tracking him down, I walked up and said, “You’re good at dispelling magick, right?”</p><p>“Better than any other student in this dang school, that’s for sure!” he said with a wry smile and a charming air.</p><p>“Can you dispel black magick?”</p><p>“Never tried, but I know the theory behind it.</p><p>Why do you ask?”</p><p>“I need to dispel some, but I don’t think I can do it alone, so I was wondering if you—“</p><p>“Don’t need to ask me twice!” he cried with delight.</p><p>After class, we went to the morgue. It lurked quietly in its corner, just like the day before—and as we stood before it, the same familiar fear came creeping over me.</p><p>The inside retained its distinctive smell, and was dark as a black cat at midnight. As we stepped across the threshold, we immediately heard a series of groans—and when I raised my staff to light the room, we saw the dead were already shambling toward us. But my best friend wasn’t worried; he immediately began to ready his anti-magick spell, humming quietly.</p><p>I knew such things took time to prepare, so I worked to draw the corpses away by setting off little fireworks at their feet. It was a pretty pathetic display of magick, and nearly useless in a fight. But if I lost heart now, I’d never be able to consider myself equal to my best friend in the entire world, which is what gave me the courage to keep going.</p><p>Suddenly, a corpse lunged at me, sending me toppling to the ground. I couldn’t bear the thought of what was about to happen, so I shut my eyes and covered my head with my arms. But then…</p><p>“Here we go!”</p><p>My friend lifted his staff in the air, where it began to emit a brilliant golden glow. The spell quickly manifested around the corpses in an intricate circle, and as it grew brighter, he recited the final words of the spell.</p><p>“Okay. We’re good now.”</p><p>The light faded. The corpses were now motionless in the darkness of the morgue. Their faces looked to be resting peacefully, as opposed to the enslavement that had plagued them not moments before, but perhaps I just imagined that.</p><p>“Our magick has finally given them true rest.”</p><p>The next thing I knew, my companion was standing beside me. For some reason, it made me think of my other best friend. Together, we prayed from the bottom of our hearts that our senior mages could  finally rest in peace.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: The Unthinkable<br>[<br>]</p><p>Noticing the light from the dispelling incantation, the guard approached the morgue.</p><p>“I just can’t believe it,” he muttered. “Two<br>students<br> undoing that dark magick?”</p><p>After the shock of seeing corpses lying still as they were meant to finally faded, he praised us for being brave, kind students.</p><p>My plan had gone so well that I felt like I was in a dream, and my best friend and I remained in high spirits as we walked back to the dorms. The old guard’s words made me forget that I was usually weak and timid. Instead, for a moment, I felt like I was someone special. And I thought that maybe—just maybe—I’d grown one step closer to<br>her<br>.</p><p>I wanted to tell her what happened today. Would she compliment me like the old guard did? I could feel my heart race as I pictured that happening, but my reverie was interrupted by my best friend.</p><p>“I don’t feel like going home yet,” he said as he pointed to the tallest building on campus. “Wanna go up the bell tower?”</p><p>“Sure,” I replied. We’d gone up there many times when we were younger, and I knew the views to be quite beautiful. High as I was on the thrill of victory, the idea of being above the entire world was something I was eager to experience again.</p><p>We reached the top of the tower, which contained a bell that was enchanted to ring at certain times throughout the day. From there, we could see the forest that surrounded both our academy and the neighboring city of mages.</p><p>“It’s such a lovely view,” I said. I’d been scared of the height when I first came up here, but it didn’t bother me anymore. I felt like I was stronger in that regard, which only added to the joy that I currently felt.</p><p>“Hey, listen,” said my friend as he sat beside me and stared out blankly into the distance. “I’m really glad your plan worked. I was a little nervous about it, but we made a pretty great team in the end.”</p><p>“I couldn’t have dispelled that black magick on my own,” I replied. “Thank you.”</p><p>He shook his head. “That’s not what I mean. I think you’re incredible for<br>wanting<br> to do it in the first place.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Those dead students were being forced to move, and you wanted to save them. It was so…kind, and I think that’s a great quality to for a person to have.”</p><p>I recalled how angry our other friend was at the prospect of black magick, even going so far as to shed tears over it. But now it felt like I and the boy beside me had grown even closer, which caused me to blush in delight.</p><p>“We really are amazing together, huh?” he continued. “I mean, we were friends right out of the gate, and now we’ve been together all this time. I don’t think I’ve ever stopped thinking about you.”</p><p>My two best friends were so talented. So capable. They were always the ones helping<br>me<br>. Luck had brought me into their orbit, but I never felt like I belonged there. And hearing him speak to me now, I almost couldn’t believe I deserved it.</p><p>“I think it’s destiny that we met,” whispered my friend. He was always so relaxed, so calm, but now he seemed nervous. “Um, do you think so? It can’t be coincidence, and so I want us to be together for as long as we can.”</p><p>I’d only ever wanted the three of us to be together forever, and his words strengthened that resolve in me. “Yes!” I cried. “Yes, I want that!”</p><p>His eyes snapped up to mine as a brilliant smile bloomed across his face. “That makes me happy—it makes me so,<br>so<br> happy.”</p><p>I meant to return his smile, but before I could, his face was approaching mine, and I felt a tepid warmth pressing lightly against my lips.</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Not Supposed to Happen<br>[<br>]</p><p>It was a morning like any other. I stepped into the classroom, rubbing my sleep—deprived eyes, and sat down next to my best friend.</p><p>“Morning!” she said. “I didn’t see you at dinner last night. You okay?”</p><p>I nodded, which seemed to sate her curiosity. A moment later, a new, chipper voice rang out.</p><p>“Morning, you two! You study for your magick history test?”</p><p>It was our other friend. The boy.</p><p>“Obviously,” she replied. “My review was perfect.”</p><p>“Oh ho! Sounds like it’s on.”</p><p>“Give it up, champ. There’s no way you’re beating me.”</p><p>Their back and forth was as flawless as always, and I was much too slow to keep up. It was odd how things seemed so<br>normal<br>.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. We should check out the new general store once class is done today.”</p><p>He suggested this as if the idea had just come to him, but my other friend shook her head.</p><p>“Sorry, I’ve got something to do. But you two go on ahead.”</p><p>My chest clenched when she said that.<br>Oh no.<br> As I floundered for something to say, she spoke up again.</p><p>“I’m obviously going to ask for a souvenir, though.”</p><p>I accepted this with a swallow and a nod, not wanting to upset her.</p><p>The new general store was so full of things that I almost didn’t know what to get. And though I felt uncomfortable walking next to him, I still had fun picking out something for our other friend. But as we walked home, he said something that made me freeze in my tracks:</p><p>“I was glad she didn’t come with us today.”</p><p>“Why?” I whispered.</p><p>“Because we could be alone. You feel the same, right?”</p><p>“I, um…”</p><p>I knew what I was going to say next would wound him, but I absolutely had to clear up this misunderstanding before it went any further.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I can’t be with you. There has to be someone out there who’s a better match than for you than me.”</p><p>My friend was silent. When I finally summoned the courage to look at him, I saw him smiling faintly—which was not at all what I was expecting.</p><p>“You really should be more confident, you know?”</p><p>What is he saying?</p><p>I don’t understand.</p><p>“You’re the perfect partner for me.”</p><p>What!?</p><p>“Still, it’s cute when you worry like that,” He chuckled at this, then opened his eyes wide. “Oh, hey! I have a present for you.”</p><p>He reached out and placed a flower-shaped pin in my hair. I flinched in surprise and jerked back, but he leaned forward and whispered into my ear.</p><p>“What? You thought I was going to kiss you?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“We’ll save that for some other time.”</p><p>His eyes belonged to a stranger. His gaze felt sticky as it moved up and down and across my body, and it took everything I had not to vomit on the spot. It reminded me how no matter how many times I’d rinsed out my mouth recently, I still couldn’t scrub the feeling from my lips.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>His whisper played in my ears over and over and over and—</p><p>“No! I hate this! I HATE it!”</p><p>Every place he touched me was covered in filth. Every glance caused my hair to stand on end.</p><p>“I’m gross! I’m dirty! I’m disgusting! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I’m going to be<br>sick<br>!”</p><p>I took a pair of scissors and jammed them into my bed over and over. By the end of it, my room was a disaster and my throat raw from screaming, but I still felt no better.</p><p>“Why…?”</p><p>If things went bad between the two of us, what would happen to me and<br>her<br>? Oh, but I knew. She’d take his side—of course she would. And then we wouldn’t be friends anymore.</p><p>“I don’t want this…”</p><p>I was a fool to think I’d gotten closer to her after releasing the corpses in the morgue from their curse. I’d been happy in that moment, but it now felt so very, very,<br>very<br> long ago.</p><p>I grabbed the flower pin and threw it against the wall as hard as I could. When I pictured how things would go in the days to come, I began to sob as an ocean of tears raged down my cheeks.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Noelle"><a href="#Noelle" class="headerlink" title="Noelle"></a>Noelle</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>When I open my eyes, a strange sensation lingers in my mind. It appears I have been dreaming. In my dream, I was flying before I fell from the sky. It is the same dream I always have. I hear dreams are what humans experience while undergoing memory reorganization. But if this is true, why do I have<br> dream? I have never flown; I have no memories of it. Maybe I only<br> I could fly. Or maybe it’s an influence from my older sister—the original.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I didn’t dream today—or maybe I did and I just don’t remember. I hear that’s possible as well, though you’d think I would know, considering that I’m dealing with my own body. We constructs are not supposed to need sleep. Not to say that we could perpetually act autonomously—just that it was planned that we’d undergo regular maintenance instead. But I’m different. I’m the only one who sleeps. Who dreams. I dream of memories that do not belong to me, memories that intermingle with my own feelings. I do not know why I am the only one to do so. But my dreams are indispensable to me. I<br> them.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>I dreamed again today—or rather, I remember my dream. I dreamed I met someone living in a small forest hut. I concentrate on the sensations I felt while sleeping, and I am overcome by the sense I am unable to breathe. This memory most certainly belonged to my elder sister. I cannot easily reach my elder sister’s memories; it is like trying to navigate a path covered in fog. Perhaps this is an effect of her losing control. But my dreams are so far removed from reality. After all, I have never seen a human before.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>When I finally exit the facility and make my way outside, I find more lush nature—and ruined cities—than in my memories. And I also find hordes of machines. But I see no humans anywhere. Not a single one. The sight is so different from my elder sister’s memories when she used to live on the surface. How long have I been asleep? How long did I dream? There is no way for me to know the answer. Will I ever reach the place from my sister’s memory? The only clues I have come to me as I dream.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Long before the youngest awakened</p><p>Machines line a darkened room like a row of steel coffins. With a sudden noise, a single door swings open. The coffin contains a sleeping girl whose pure-white hair reaches down to her shoulders. As her lashes flutter faintly, her eyelids slowly lift.</p><p>Dark orange eyes shine out. They dart back and forth in an attempt to grasp the situation. The first thing she sees is a monitor affixed to the wall. Then a dozen or so unmoving female figures. She blinks once and stares at their faces. She turns her gaze to each, one after the other. After a moment, she realizes they are all identical.</p><p>Eyes. Hair. Lips. Ears. Skin. Clothing. Height. Weight. Every detail is perfectly matched.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl shows no surprise at this. But it’s not as if she knew it was coming. In truth, she knows nothing at all. Her expression is simply blank. As blank as her shimmering white hair.</p><p>She exits the machine and takes a few steps forward. She passes the other girls and comes to the center of the room, then looks around again. There are around a dozen girls, and an equal number of empty machines. It seems she is the last to awaken. The monitor is blank. Besides the floor and walls and ceiling, there is nothing else to the room. Having taken in the room, she now looks down at herself. Her clothes are the same as her companions. Her collar—which is high enough to hide her mouth—contains a small apparatus on the inside.</p><p>The girl turns to look at the monitor. Her face appears on it, a reflection from what scant light exists within the room. The face in the reflection matches the other girls. A pair of emotionless eyes stare back at her. After a time, the screen lights up blue. White shapes are projected on the monitor. They blink and change shape, over and over again.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl understands nothing; she simply stares at the dancing figures on the screen.</p><p>Suddenly, the apparatus in her collar springs to life, accompanied by a high-pitched sound. The moment it does, the girl’s consciousness is flipped upside down. Voices ring in her head. Scenery dashes across her vision. Information flows inside her like a raging river. Her head feels hot. The hallucinations link together; images become words in her consciousness as they burn into her mind.</p><p>V    O  IC E  CO L O   R  P  AI  N LI G  HT HE  A T FOR M S HA D OW</p><p>vOICE COLoR PAiN LIghT HEat ForM shaDoW</p><p>voice color pain light heat form shadow</p><p>huff* <em>huff</em></p><p>The girl’s vision returns. Her breathing remains ragged, her footing unsteady. But now she understands.<br>We are weapons.<br> She brushes aside her sweat-slicked bangs and directs her attention to the monitor. It contains writing in stark white letters:</p><p>“ELEVENTH FORCED MEMORY CONFERMENT SUCCESSFUL.”</p><p>Weapons built from plants or animals are known as “living weapons.” In the case of these girls, they are based on a single human. From the time they were born to the moment they woke up, they were implanted with the instincts of a weapon and administered drugs that forcefully caused them to mature. Once they are ready, they will be given the necessary knowledge to function as a weapon and sent into battle. They will never know the meaning of killing—or of living.</p><p>Now, a new mission is ready for them. The order appears on the screen:</p><p>“EXTERMINATE THE THIRTEEN TARGETS.”</p><p>Multiples of an identical voice echo through the room, all saying the same word: “Yes.”</p><p>Following the description of the operation, target information appears on the screen. There is no sound; merely words and charts that appear on the screen one after the other before vanishing again.</p><p>“END BRIEFING. COMMENCE OPERATION.”<br>With that, the monitor goes dark once more. With the blue light gone, the room is again plunged into shadow. A white light pours in, tearing the gloom apart. A portion of the wall moves, granting a view of the outside world. A black van appears in the light. The girls begin their operation, piling into the vehicle with perfectly synchronized footsteps.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Approximately twenty-one minutes have passed since the beginning of the operation. Within an area that was once the city center, the girls stand and stare at a single point. They encountered the first target four minutes after arriving at their destination. But things have not yet proceeded to a combat situation. There is one reason for that…</p><p>The girls stare at their lone target. Much like the girls, it is made with humanoid elements, including a head, torso, and four limbs. But each part is warped and twisted, like a doll haphazardly stitched together. Its skin reflects the sunlight, creating an eerie rainbow. All these facts are just as their intel said it would be.</p><p>The girl at the rear of the group is the one who woke up last. She wields a sniper rife.</p><p>“……”</p><p>She peers down the sight, checking on her allies. The ones on the front line wield swords and other close-combat weapons. Those with spears, greatswords, and other large weapons stand behind them, while those with long-range weapons—like the girl herself—watch and wait from even further in the rearguard. The weapons were procured from the self-driving vehicle they used for transport. Each girl was allotted a different one that signified their role. Though they all share the same faces and minds, they soon begin to separate from one another based on the weapon they have been given. After checking on her allies, the girl sights the target.</p><p>Something is different from their pre-battle information: The target shows no reaction to their presence. While it seems to know they are there, it shows no interest, instead choosing to draw idly on the ground with a single finger. This behavior is strange; they had been told their target exhibited characteristics of being “violent and cruel.” This expected behavior was the reason they had approached the upcoming battle with such caution.</p><p>Five minutes later, events finally begin to unfold. A sword-wielding girl approaches the target. She walks with slow, measured steps. The sniper carefully observes the situation. When the sword-wielder is fifteen meters away, there is movement. Empty eyes turn to stare at her. They survey her calmly. The moment she raises her sword, the target leaps into the air.</p><p>The battle has begun. The target twists in the air and uses the speed of its fall to slam its arms down on the sword wielder. She blocks the attack with the blunt edge of her weapon. A cloud of dust rises in the air at the impact. In the midst of it, the girl’s eyes glow red. Empty eyes lock onto a crimson gaze. Both are shaped like humans, but both are false. A red light zips around within the dust. Blows and parries are traded with inhuman speed. Attacks collide. The red light stops. The dust slowly settles, exposing the pair. The sniper takes in a short breath and holds it. She pulls the trigger.</p><p>The bullet pierces the air. The moment the sound reaches the target’s ears, its left arm is blown from its body. The shock robs the creature of its ferocity. It slowly collapses into a defenseless heap. Another girl leaps forward from behind the sword user. Her spear pierces their foe, ending it.<br>Target one, silenced.<br> The sniper thinks these words to herself. At the same time, she notices a strange sensation. Almost like a hole is being filled. But the girl does not understand what the feeling is, or what brought it about. As though confirming something, she looks at her palms. There is nothing there. Even though she had just felt she had obtained something.</p><p>“…Huh?”<br>She readjusts the grip on her rifle and stands. With the strange sensation still in her chest, the girl and her companions set out for the next target. In front is the one who wields the sword. The roles given to them in battle had led her to assume a natural position of leadership. The girl in front looks down at her palm as they walk. She also does not know the source of her discomfort. What they feel is not joy in victory; simply excitement that their perfectly coordinated actions have led to success. But the girls do not yet understand that.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>A white shadow dashes across the ruins. The girl runs silently; ahead, her companions are locked in battle with a mighty foe. If her hurried footsteps make even the slightest sound, the operation will end in failure. Yet if she slows her pace in hesitation, there would be many casualties.<br>What’s the best plan of action?<br> The girl runs. She wipes her bloody hands on her sleeve, adjusts her grip on her rifle, and increases her pace.</p><p>They encountered the mighty foe fifteen minutes ago. They had just eliminated the eleventh target when it happened: Calamity itself rose up above the ruins of a building. It stood nearly ten meters high. Its body was unnatural—an image of the human form, but forcefully stretched and enlarged, with skin scarred like an old roadmap.</p><p>It was a mutant:</p><p>A being that had somehow gained characteristics which typically did not exist in their kind. This information was shared with them before the battle. But while they expected the mutant target, the did not expect it to appear with such<br>speed<br>. The mutant fell from the sky like a meteorite, crushing one of the girls on contact. Before the group could even register this fact, it had felled another of their number. The girls’ blood rained down across the ruined city. The mutant’s empty eyes towered above them.</p><p>Which brings us to the present. While the group successfully reorganized their formation, the battle has not yet turned in their favor. Dodging the mutant’s constant blows, the girls deliver their own. But their blades cannot pierce its thick skin. Their movements begin to slow, exhaustion taking hold as attack after attack comes up empty.</p><p>But then, the sound of an explosion from behind the target: The unmistakable percussion of a sniper rifle. A large bullet pierces the mutant’s neck, causing the massive figure to stagger. But it quickly recovers. The bullet’s path becomes another scar. As the girl loads another bullet in the chamber, the mutant makes a slow turn to face her….</p><p>Which is exactly what she wants. The human body is covered with soft muscle and skin that stretches and contracts as it moves. And the larger a body is, the more that muscle and skin is forced to move and contract—and to stretch thin. The scars on the mutant’s skin are places that have been damaged from this constant stretching. It was the sword-wielder who first realized this. As the mutant turns, a scar tears open on its lower back. And while its attention is focused elsewhere, the sword-wielder leaps high in the air and slams her weapon through the opening.</p><p>The mutant lets out a cry as it crumbles to the ground. The girl continues running up its back, dragging her blade behind her to create a massive canyon of flesh and bone. Blood fountains from the wound, painting her red. The mutant falls face first onto the ground. The earth shakes. Dust flies. The moment it falls, the remaining girls focus their attack on the head. Specifically the neck, where the bullet has created a new scar. The sniper fires again, creating a new furrow in the creature. The rest of the group attacks this new opening with relish. The mutant shivers. It howls. Its fingers contract, convulse…and then, finally, it moves no more. Watching from a distance, the sniper releases her grip on her rifle and lets out her breath. The purpose of holding her breath is to steady her aim. It is only natural to exhale after the shot. But this time, it almost sounds like a sigh of relief. She shoulders her rifle and prepares to rejoin the group.</p><p>But before she can move, a sound erupts behind her. It is the thirteenth target. It had emerged from the ruins close to the isolated sniper, and now tears out her windpipe. Blood mists across the air. Crimson spreads over the ground.</p><p>“……”<br>A ragged breath escapes from her ripped throat. In her dimming consciousness, the girl looks at her palm. All she finds is her bloody, lifeless hand.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>And so, the thirteenth target falls. With the operation complete, the driverless vehicle returns. The armored machine carries the group back to the place where they first woke up. It is dark in the vehicle, and featureless save for slots to store weapons and handrails along the sides. It is the typical construction for a vehicle that carries weapons.</p><p>The automobile motors across the wilderness. The girls sit on the floor inside. A full half of them do not make the return trip. The air is filled with the scent of metal and oppressive silence. The weapons on the wall still drip with blood. One of the girls stares at them for no reason in particular. She sees her own sword, as well as a number of weapons that no longer have anyone to wield them. Some of the slots contain nothing at all, their weapons having been too damaged to recover. In particular, many guns are missing, and the largest such gap is one that used to hold a sniper rifle. A thought crosses the girl’s mind as she stares at the space:</p><p>There is a hole that will never be filled.</p><p>The journey continues. No one speaks. Despite the silence, they still hear nothing from outside the vehicle. Finally, the girl stops staring at the weapons and closes her eyes. She leans back and waits for time to pass. She knows the return trip is the same distance as the first, but it seems to be taking much, much longer. It feels like she will be in this vehicle forever.</p><p>Some time later…</p><p>The vehicle finally comes to a stop. Its doors open automatically. Light pours inside. The girls file out. Some walk slowly, nursing wounds. Some walk slowly, nursing exhaustion. But the girl who had her eyes closed does not move; instead, she remains in the vehicle and listens to the footsteps of her companions slowly fade into the distance. Once that sound is no more, she opens her eyes, forces herself to her feet, and steps out. The moment she touches the ground, the sound of the large doors closing begins. On a whim, she turns back to look. She sees the wall of weapons slowly disappear.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The engine begins to hum. The girl stands in place, completely alone, until the vehicle drives off.</p><p>When the girls return to their dark room, they see cold white letters on a blue screen.</p><p>“WELL DONE.”</p><p>“THERE ARE FEWER CASUALTIES THAN ESTIMATED.”</p><p>The words of praise flicker for a moment before vanishing. A rundown of their next operation suddenly springs to life on the screen. Though the objective and plan remain the same, the scale this time will be larger, including the number of targets. Which means their numbers will need to be replenished. The girls stare silently at the screen. Once the mission statement is complete, the screen urges them to enter the row of machines for rest and wound treatment.</p><p>Each girl replies with a single word: “Yes.”</p><p>But unlike the last time, they do not speak in unison. The screen falls dark. The girls follow orders and return to their coffins.</p><p>Inside, the girl who closed her eyes cannot stop her thoughts.</p><p>They estimated the number of dead and injured. Those deaths had been predicted from the start. I am alive. But that only means I survived this day. If I die tomorrow, I will be replaced. The fight will go on.</p><p>She feels a sense of unease. Her thoughts spin as she drops her gaze to her palms. There is nothing there. Perhaps there had never been<br>anything<br> there. What was she trying to think of? She does not know. The machine fills with liquid. Her consciousness fades. She had felt something in her hand. But now she feels nothing. How can there be nothing? Her question still unanswered, the girl slips into the dark.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Weapon’s Travels<br>[<br>]</p><p>The girl lived in a house with her parents, one where the garden was visible from the window.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Griff"><a href="#Griff" class="headerlink" title="Griff"></a>Griff</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>“What should I do…?”</p><p>I sit in the briefing room, continuing to turn the problem over and over in my mind. I’ve been up all night thinking about it and am now beyond exhausted. See, I have to write a telegram to my family back home, but I can’t think of a single thing to say. My squad came back victorious from battle a few days ago, at which point everyone sat down and wrote their parents just like always. I joined the army eight years ago… And I haven’t contacted my family a single time. It would be strange to send them something now. Crazy. And every time I think back on my time with them, I come up with more excuses not to do it.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>My fellow soldiers are loud and boisterous, like always. I begin to wonder what kinds of messages they send. I sit still and listen in, hoping it will give me a better idea of what to write.</p><p>One man says he sent his parents a telegram about being promoted to captain. It’s not true—he made it up—but his parents love hearing stories about how successful he is, so he figures it’s okay to stretch the truth a little.</p><p>Another man’s telegrams always focus on memories he and his parents made together. Today’s letter is all about how they used to play ball with each other; he claims it will distract them from how lonely they are now that’s he’s gone.</p><p>Everyone speaks so cheerfully about the thought they put into telegrams home. And though they are my comrades—and my friends—I can’t help but feel the gulf between our lives. The worlds we grew up in were too different.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Here’s the thing: Ours is a country that values military might above all else, but my parents? They’re both anti-war activists. Needless to say, their beliefs earned me more than my share of dirty looks and unkind whispers when I was a kid.</p><p>One day, the army shot and killed my father. What a joke, right? He’s spent his entire life preaching peace, then died without accomplishing a single damn thing. I took a lesson from that: Give your life some meaning. Make it<br>. Later, I decided to join the army and climb the ranks—but when I told Mom about my plan, she said I was insane. The moment she spoke those words, I knew I had to get out of that house. So I slammed the door and stormed off, then spent years trying and failing to forget the empty look in her eyes as I departed.</p><p>In an ironic twist, I never did climb the ladder the way I swore I would. But today, after eight years spent trying to bury every last memory of my family, I finally figure out the telegram I want to send: It’s an apology.</p><p>For everything.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>I’m nervous after I send the telegram. What if she doesn’t respond? Hell, what if she disowns me? I couldn’t blame her for that. But before I can think too hard about it, I get her response:</p><p>Why was my father an anti-war activist, anyway? Why did my joining the army weigh so heavily on my mother? I don’t have a clue, because I’ve spent my whole life actively avoiding a search for those answers. The mistakes I made in the past will never go away. But as I think of my military companions and their families, another thought comes to me: I risked my life for these people. Gave everything for them. And I’m more proud of that fact than anything else. But while I salute them, I doubt it will convey these feelings that well up within me.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>When he enlisted in the Military</p><p>A perfectly ordered military procession marches forth, boots pounding in synch on the hardscrabble ground. Troops kick up dirt in the training range as they run through an endless series of drills.</p><p>If a person joins the military, they are essentially offering up their life to a country. For when the time comes, they will be thrown into battle without hesitation or mercy. Yet in this poor country, there is no end to the number of candidates eagerly waiting to enlist. This is because the monetary bonus for joining is substantial. Thousands upon thousands apply to join every year, each one drawn by the well-known catchphrase: “Join in a day, eat for a lifetime!” But with so many applicants, the army can afford to be picky—and most would-be recruits end up washing out. Those who are successful are assigned to one of several squads, where they serve under a captain, as well as senior squadmates who function as instructors. Squads eat together, sleep together, and train together. The idea is to teach discipline through group activities.</p><p>This is a small base stationed at the border of the country. The new recruits stand in a row in the briefing room. At the front of the room, the captain calls the name of a recruit who achieved top scores in the military exam. In response, a young man steps forward and snaps off a dignified salute. The captain expresses his high hopes for the young recruit, who barks out a loud “Sir, yes, sir!” in reply. Everyone present can feel the ambition burning inside him.</p><p>A few nights later, loud voices ring out in the dorm. The young man has started an argument with a fellow squad member. The two had been in competition with each other since the day they arrived, and often butted heads. Yet while the young man had a reputation for arrogance and was generally avoided by his fellow soldiers, he managed to form a sort of relationship with the other man despite their rivalry. He was his friend—perhaps his<br>only<br> friend. As their argument heats up, the other soldiers gather around and egg them on, clearly enjoying the show.</p><p>“You’re always so goddamn selfish!” cries the friend.</p><p>He is angry—almost quaking with rage—yet the young man is equally furious.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I actually have things I want to ACHIEVE!”</p><p>The argument quickly turns violent, forcing the other soldiers to intervene—but they have trouble pulling the two apart. The fight ends as suddenly as it began when a door opens. The moment the squad catches sight of their captain, they grow silent and fall in at perfect attention. The captain just mutters and shakes his head at the pair before ordering them to clean the storage room as punishment. The senior who was responsible for instructing the pair is also ordered to pitch in, and his irritation is clear.</p><p>When they reach the storage room, they find it in a state of extreme disarray.</p><p>“Can’t believe the damn captain is making me do this,” grumbles the young man.</p><p>“I mean, this is grunt work! What’s even the point!?”</p><p>“Move your hands, not your mouth,” responds the instructor.</p><p>“Accepting punishment is part of being a soldier.”</p><p>The silence of his fellow squadmates as they clean only spurs the young man’s irritation further.</p><p>“This is stupid. I have things I have to accomplish. I need to fight! I need to win a medal of honor!”</p><p>A medal of honor. It is the highest honor awarded by their country, given only to soldiers who accomplish greatness. Those who receive it are said to be destined for success.</p><p>“I’m going to be the best,” continues the young man, “and everyone else is going to know it!”</p><p>Though many members of the army enlist for the cash bonus, the young man joined only to fulfill the ambition in his heart. But this is the first time he’s ever told his squadmates about his true goals. He has skill to spare in the military arts, so it’s clearly not some flash-in-the-pan ideal. The relief he feels at finally expressing it is palpable.</p><p>His speech made, the young man makes to leave the storage room. When his friend reminds him their work has only begun, he keeps walking and says: “My part’s done. I’m going to sleep.”</p><p>Ambitious goals cannot be achieved alone. It takes the work of those who walk beside us. This is clearly a lesson the young man has yet to learn. The remaining two soldiers in the storage room smile wryly at each other, each of them silently mulling over this very thought.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several days later…</p><p>The squad is called together for a strategy meeting. As they gather in the briefing room, tension fills the air. The silence is perfect. But after ten long minutes, the briefing has yet to begin. It seems the captain has slept in.<br>Again.<br> This realization spurs the young man’s frustration anew.</p><p>Finally, the captain arrives in a disheveled state.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” he says to muted laughter.</p><p>“Guess I missed the alarm again.”</p><p>This said, he turns serious, as does the rest of the room.</p><p>“Here’s the latest: We’ve detected enemy forces marching en masse toward the border.”</p><p>Any remaining smiles in the room vanish at this news. The captain begins explaining their mission.</p><p>“We are to stop the enemy’s advance and protect our nation’s territory. And as luck would have it, this base is directly in their path.”<br>“Our<br>only<br> objective is to protect this base. We just need the enemy to withdraw while keeping our losses to a minimum.”</p><p>The briefing room fills with murmurs at this news. Reactions run the gamut from enthusiasm to relief to unease. But the young man leaps to his feet and asks permission to speak. Stifling a tired yawn, the captain tells him to continue. The sneer on the young man’s face is clear to all. After some initial comments on the state of the enemy, he voices disagreement with the plan, and suggests a total annihilation of their forces instead. A nervous buzz ripples through the room. But the young man ignores it and continues pressing his case.</p><p>“These people have threatened our borders for far too long! If we take out one of their squadrons, we’ll be heroes! People will have to—“</p><p>“That’s enough, soldier,” says the captain softly. “Remember what I said? The most important part of this plan is defending the base and keeping casualties to a bare minimum. Because if any of the men here die, that falls on me.”</p><p>Rather than backing down, the young man redoubles his efforts and engages in verbal sparring with the captain for some time.</p><p>In the end, however, he is overruled and the briefing ends. His plan rejected, the young man is infuriated.</p><p>“Why the hell doesn’t he get it!? I’m thinking of this squad far more than he is!”</p><p>Still convinced his plan is correct, he makes the rounds of his fellow soldiers, looking for any who might agree with him. With the arrogant attitude he has always displayed to his fellows, he does not find many who will side with him. Even the man he thinks of as his best friend turns him down. It’s not that he doesn’t desire glory; everyone in the squad wants nothing more than to wear a medal of honor. But he joined the military to keep his head down, follow orders, and send money home to his family. So he can’t risk everything on his friend’s reckless plan.</p><p>Were these reasons true? Perhaps. Or perhaps he is simply irritated the young man is crafting alternative plans on his own without even consulting anyone. The young man realizes his friend has balled his hand into a fist. With the thoughts and emotions of the pair still at odds, the day of the operation grows ever closer…</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The battlefield is silent; it’s almost impossible to believe a war ever raged here. All the young man can hear is his own ragged breath. He stands in the borders of the base; scattered before him are countless numbers of corpses. There is no doubt who they are.</p><p>Four hours earlier…</p><p>The enemy arrives at the base, and the battle begins. The squad digs in and defends the base from the enemy, just as the captain ordered. But the young man, impatient with this war of attrition, decides to commence with his own plan. Taking advantage of the terrain surrounding the base, he launches a surprise attack that takes out half the enemy in a single swoop. He is joined by a handful of soldiers who see things his way—and though many of them fall in battle, their bold tactics force the enemy to initiate a full retreat. As he watches his foes scatter, the young man grins.</p><p>“I was right,” he whispers.</p><p>“I was<br>right<br>.”</p><p>Though his squad had not accomplished much in battle until now, they are sure to earn praise for this great victory. He is one step closer to his medal of honor.</p><p>With those thoughts in his mind, he returns to the base—but the sight waiting for him there is a hellscape. His squadmates—all of them—lie dead or dying on the ground. Dumbfounded, he wanders among their bodies, the smell of burnt flesh and blood and gunpowder stinging his nostrils. It is the most horrific sight the young man has ever seen. He forces his breathing to slow and resists the urge to vomit.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he tells himself.</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>And though his legs feel heavy and false, he forces them to carry him forward. But then his foot catches on something and he tumbles to the ground. At his feet is one of his squad members, heavily injured and covered in dirt and debris from an explosion. It is his instructor. Though he still breathes, it is with great difficulty, as he is bleeding from multiple wounds.</p><p>“Hey! Wake up!”</p><p>Realizing the young man is speaking to him, the instructor manages to open a single eye. It roves about blindly for a moment before finally settling on the figure of the young man.</p><p>“You…attacked the enemy…”</p><p>“Knew you would…”</p><p>“The captain…tried to save you…”</p><p>“He changed…our formation… and now look at us…”</p><p>With that, the instructor draws one last, hitching breath before falling silent forever.</p><p>The captain did this for me?<br> thinks the young man.<br>But I always caused him so much trouble…</p><p>Unable to accept his instructor’s death, the young man wanders the battlefield in a haze, searching for his captain.</p><p>Instead, he finds what remains of his only friend. An explosion has blasted off most of his left leg, leaving a pool of blood at the base of the stump.</p><p>“Good to see you’re in one piece…” says his friend.</p><p>The fact he is still able to make jokes in such a condition is remarkable. The young man begins stammering out an apology.</p><p>“I’m… I’m sorry. I just wanted…”</p><p>“I know,” whispers his friend.</p><p>“I wanted one too…”</p><p>“Said this was for my family…but that medal sure would have been nice…”</p><p>With that, he speaks no more. Tears begin to run from the young man’s eyes as he sets off again in search of his captain. He sees bodies. Bodies.<br>Bodies.<br> Each one bearing a familiar face.</p><p>Finally, he sees the captain and runs to his side. He calls out to him again and again, but the man makes no response.</p><p>“Sir, I… I didn’t mean…”</p><p>He grasps the captain’s ravaged hand. He wants the captain to reprimand him. He<br>needs<br> it. Otherwise, his apology would be meaningless. There is so much to say: He’d made a horrible mistake. He’d been wrong where the captain had been right. But he can scarcely force two words together. And the tears that pour down his face only make things harder. But then the young man realizes something:</p><p>The captain is squeezing his hand in return.<br>He’s still breathing. He’s ALIVE!</p><p>“Ah,” says the captain weakly.</p><p>“I’m glad you survived…”</p><p>The captain’s eyes are closed; his senses all but gone. There is no way he can know whose hand he grasps. And yet somehow, he seems to recognize the young man, and ends his life with a faint smile on his face. With that, the operation is over. The young man is the only survivor.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Though it came at the cost of everything, the young man is finally a hero. For despite the sacrifices required, the enemy had withdrawn. The young man is given time off to recuperate. Which is how he finds himself with nothing to do. Or perhaps it is more apt to say there is nothing he<br>can<br> do. Day after day, he hides in his house and attempts to drown his sorrows with strong drink. Empty bottles lie scattered across his floor. Rats run to and fro amidst the refuse and spoil. He wakes up, grabs a bottle, and drinks until he passes out. When he come to, he begins the process all over again. If that was his entire life, it might be all right. But he sees flashbacks to the battle in his sleep, and these nightmares torture him.</p><p>The battleground…</p><p>The faces of enemies he killed…</p><p>His squadmates dying before his eyes…</p><p>His instructor. His best friend. The captain. All of them die in his arms.</p><p>Day after day</p><p>after day after day after day</p><p>after day after day after day after day</p><p>after day after day after day after day</p><p>The nightmares play on repeat, bringing his life to a halt.</p><p>If only I hadn’t made that suggestion…</p><p>If only I hadn’t ignored my orders…</p><p>If only… If only… If only…</p><p>His world becomes an endless spiral of regret.</p><p>Was there even a point to what I did?</p><p>Do I feel pride in what I did?</p><p>Was there justice to what I did?</p><p>Is this all because of my selfishness? Because of a goddamn medal?</p><p>Maybe I should just end it all.</p><p>He drunkenly loads bullets into his gun, raises the muzzle to his temple, and stands.</p><p>He places his finger on the trigger, closes his eyes, and breaths in a lungful of stale air.</p><p>“Hold on, everyone… I’m coming.”</p><p>He moves to pull the trigger. But he is drunker than he imagines, and with his eyes closed, his balance flees and sends him crashing into a nearby table.</p><p>When he opens his eyes, he sees a familiar envelope. It is the kind used for notices by the military’s highest-ranking officials. Inside is an official letter congratulating him on annihilating the enemy, and announcing that he will be rewarded with a medal of honor and promotion to captain.</p><p>“Ridiculous…” mutters the young man.</p><p>“Goddamn ridiculous…”</p><p>“I’m only alive because the rest of them saved me.”</p><p>Seeing the letter again reminds him that the ceremony is tomorrow. Finally, he takes a handful of sleeping pills and falls into bed.</p><p>He dreams. It is the same dream as ever—a dream of that day. But this time, it does not begin after the battle. Instead, it begins before he set off to face the enemy on his own.<br>No. I won’t make the same mistake again.</p><p>This time, he does not initiate his plan. Instead, he remains at the base and kills every last enemy soldier he sees, swearing he will make sure they never kill again. He slays as if in the grip of madness. Enemy soldiers fall—so many he cannot count their number. But it doesn’t matter; he will do anything to save his brothers. Suddenly, he looks out and sees the faces of the people he has been slaughtering: They are all part of his squad. His instructor. His friend. His captain. He killed them with his own hands once more. With a short cry, the young man finally understands:</p><p>“I’ll never be able to save them, no matter what I do.”</p><p>The sickening dream wakes him up. The morning sun streams in through the window. It is the day of the medal ceremony—the day of what he<br>thought<br> was his dearest wish. What meaning can there be in someone who wiped out his own squad accepting a medal? How can he face their memory? And when the ceremony is over, he will be a captain. A leader with troops of his own.</p><p>“What do I do, Captain? How do I atone for my sins?”<br>He asks himself this as he puts on his formal dress uniform.

According to the children, the boy passes this place every day on his way to do his shopping. Knowing this, I sit down to wait.</p><p>I sit for hours, barely moving, alone with my thoughts. Just as the sun began to set, he finally appears. When he notices me, his eyes widen slightly and he comes to a halt.</p><p>“Why are you…?” he begins. He’s clearly shocked, so I spare him any further abuse and get right to it.</p><p>“You didn’t kill him. Did you?”</p><p>All he has to do is shake his head and it will all be over. Yet for some reason, he doesn’t.</p><p>“I can clear this entire thing up,” I continue. “Just come back with me and—“</p><p>Before I can say more, he draws the blade hanging at his hip and points it at me.</p><p>“No. I killed him. That’s why I came here.”</p><p>Though the tip of the blade presses ever closer to my throat, I don’t move an inch. He wouldn’t kill one of his own. He wouldn’t. He<br>couldn’t<br>.</p><p>Finally, the boy sighs, sheathes his blade, and walks past me with quick steps. “Just leave me alone,” he says before vanishing to somewhere further down the road.</p><p>It’s hot. The sun burns the nape of my neck as my head hangs low. I stare at my feet—at a puddle created by the cannon on the old tracks. The man I see there—a man with the same face as me—begins to cackle.</p><p>“Didn’t I say this would happen? This is all your fault! You saved him, and now someone with a bright future is—“</p><p>I stamp my foot into the puddle and shut the man up.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Reflections of A Fool<br>[<br>]</p><p>There was a murder in the squadron. The prime suspect was the boy who was known for being a problem, but I knew he would never do such a thing.</p><p>Or at least, I thought I knew.</p><p>Because when I broke probation and went to the border city where he was hiding, he admitted to being the killer.</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>“Captain. Are you there?”</p><p>The voice is followed by a knock at the door. It’s my subordinate, the same one who helped me slip away while I was on probation.</p><p>I’d returned to the barracks two weeks ago, and he’d checked on me every day since. I know he wants to hear what happened in the city, but I can’t tell him.</p><p>I can’t tell<br>anyone<br>.</p><p>Because my men would never forgive me.</p><p>If you didn’t go out of your way to save his life, there would have been no murder. Everything you do leads us into the jaws of death. All you know how to do is sin.</p><p>When I come to, I’m crouched in the corner of my room waiting for it all to be over.</p><p>Aw, look how upset you are! Keep that up, and your soldiers will never take you seriously again.</p><p>That voice again. Shaking it off, I stand and plant myself in front of the mirror, looking back at the man who shares my face.</p><p>I know how you can escape this darkness,<br> he says.</p><p>I reach out and brush my fingertips against the glass.<br>“Tell me.”</p><p>The man in the mirror smiles kindly.<br>It’s easy. Kill the criminal and atone. That’s the only way to save your soul—and the soul of your dead subordinate.</p><p>“I have to… kill him?”</p><p>Yes. Kill him. Just like you killed me.</p><p>As I gaze into the darkened eyes of the man in the mirror, I think back. My selfishness once cost the lives of many of my compatriots. So once I became a captain, I strove to always be thoughtful and attentive so I wouldn’t make the same mistake twice.</p><p>I killed the true me—the arrogant face in the mirror.<br>It was all I could think to do to absolve myself.</p><p>Kill him with your own hands.</p><p>I must… kill him.</p><p>I must<br>kill<br> him. It’s the only way to atone.</p><p>So that night, I slip out once more, seeking to avenge one of my soldiers and absolve myself of sin for good and all.</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>I walk for hours before finally coming to a familiar set of train tracks. As midnight comes and goes, I see distant flames dancing in the summertime sky.</p><p>The fires of battle rage in the border city.</p><p>As I pass retreating soldiers, understanding finally dawns. Our army has finally launched an attack on this city. They did so while I was on probation.</p><p>As the sunflowers along the tracks crackle and burn, a small moth descends and vanishes into the flame.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Midnight Star<br>[<br>]</p><p>The young boy from my squad confessed to murdering one of his fellow soldiers. If I hadn’t gone out of my way to save the boy on our previous mission, the other man would still be alive. This is all my fault.</p><p>I make for the border city where he’s hiding so I can kill him and absolve myself of this sin. But when I arrive, the city is nothing but a burning husk. The army had long been plotting to advance on the city, and this was the night they finally put their plan into motion.</p><p>I walk and walk and walk, but all I see are bodies. Bodies.<br>Bodies.<br> There isn’t a single survivor to be found.</p><p>As the smell of burning flesh fills my nostrils, the stench makes flashes of a hell I once witnessed play in my mind. A time when I had just joined the army—and when my own selfishness caused my entire squad to perish.</p><p>I shake my head, erasing the sight. There’s no time to be thinking of the past. I have to find the boy, kill him, and finally atone.</p><p>But look at this place. Nothing could have survived. If the boy was here, he’s already dead.</p><p>As the thought crosses my mind, a sound comes from the burnt building beside me. If memory serves, it was once the HQ of the city’s self-defense force—the organization that tried so desperately to bring life to the town.</p><p>The fire has died down, so I slip through the entrance, hold my breath, and make my way down the hall as I follow a trail of blood.</p><p>This will be a fine resting place for you.</p><p>I find the boy in a room at the end of the hall. He’s on the floor, holding the bloody corpse of a woman in his arms. Next to her is a single burned sunflower.</p><p>The blood in the hallway must have belonged to the woman. It seems impossible for the small-framed boy to have carried her all this way, but he must have done so. Whoever she is, she looks almost exactly like him. But none of that matters now, because my only objective is to finish this.</p><p>I stand in the doorway and aim my gun, ready to finally absolve myself of my sins. But as my finger slips to the trigger, he looks up at me with a tear-stained face that causes me to take a step backwards.</p><p>In that instant, it all comes flooding back. Memories of the time when I’d just joined the army. When I pushed my squad to annihilation because of my selfishness. And the absolute hell I’d existed in ever since.</p><p>Captain, I…</p><p>I’d sobbed over my captain’s body, repeating those two words over and over. As I cursed my foolishness, I told myself I would never make the same mistake again. I would never lose another ally the way I lost him.</p><p>“Shoot him!” cries a sudden voice. I look up and see the man with my face shouting at me from a reflection in the window. “Shoot him! Erase your sins! That’s why you’re here, isn’t it?!”</p><p>Yes. That’s why I’m here. I can only atone by killing him.</p><p>Had I not saved him in battle, he would have never killed the other man. It’s my fault I lost another of my allies, and I have to fix my mistake.</p><p>But the boy with the corpse in his arms and tears streaming down his face…</p><p>He looks<br>so much<br> like me.</p><p>“<br>Shoot!<br>“ cries the man in the window again. And this time, I obey. I pull the trigger. The bullet flies, shattering the window where the face had been a moment before.</p><p>I lower my weapon and rush to the boy, who drops his gaze and begins to mutter in a voice thick with tears.</p><p>“Thought… I told you to stay away from me…”</p><p>“Yeah. You did. But…” I pause, unable to figure out what comes next. But at last, I say:</p><p>“I’m glad you survived.”</p><p>That’s all.</p><p>The boy admitted to killing his squadmate. Yet.<br>And yet.<br> He is still one of my own, a comrade-in-arms with whom I’ve survived battles and hardships.</p><p>And I cannot be happy with his death.</p><p>Now that he sits before me, I finally realize I’d taken up a gun to right my own mistakes. I was going to kill for the sake of a dead comrade.</p><p>That’s not atoning. It’s ego. Selfishness.</p><p>I’m not interested in saving my companions. Oh no. I just want to be forgiven.</p><p>“Everyone wants to hear your side of the story,” I say. “Come home. Tell the truth.” But he just shakes his head.</p><p>“There are some things I can’t say,” he says in a voice colored in agony. And when he looks at me again, I can’t bring myself to force the truth from him.</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>A month has passed since we parted ways at the border city.</p><p>I’m currently rifling through files in the storage room where the incident occurred. I want to know the truth the boy was hiding, but I’m coming up empty. No surprise there—any files have likely been intentionally destroyed. Hell, even the fact the boy was once part of my squad is now nothing but a distant rumor.</p><p>When I think about it rationally, it’s all been so strange. A murder happened between two people with a boring, normal relationship, and the military ordered the perpetrator shot on sight without even holding a trial.</p><p>Light leaks in through the crack in the reference room door. I stare at it, recalling how distressed the boy had looked. He was a criminal who killed one of his own, which is a fact I’ve grown to accept. But<br>why<br> did he do it? What was the reason?</p><p>I wish I could have brought some light to the dark truth that weighed on him. I wish I could have helped him. That’s also the job of a captain, and I failed.</p><p>If I ever get the chance to see him again, I’m going to learn the truth. Nothing will stop me this time—no matter how many orders I have to break.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Soldier’s Crimes<br>[<br>]</p><p>Hello.<br>Mama<br> here.

Furthermore, I hear he has been calmer since losing his squad in a recent mission, so perhaps that experience has served as a catalyst for self-improvement. However, even if this change of heart does not stick, command is well aware that soldiers with his personality type are very good at controlling subordinates, which makes the subject of his temperament ultimately inconsequential.</p><p>It is our opinion that his particular blend of combat prowess and tactical aptitude, coupled with his personality, will help him rise through the ranks quickly, and that he may, in fact, lead our entire force one day.</p><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Fifty Years Post-War<br>[<br>]</p><p>Retired Soldier A: That battle was hell.

His eyes were the devil’s, cold and heartless as an ice storm. I don’t think that man had a drop of human blood in him; hell, he was the same one who sculpted the mountains of corpses and unleashed the rivers of blood. And sure, I survived, but I still remember the fear. The fear never went away.</p><p>I hear that devil is still hailed as a hero in his homeland.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Lars"><a href="#Lars" class="headerlink" title="Lars"></a>Lars</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>I inhale a lungful of battlefield air, rich with a mix of gunsmoke and blood. Our operation was a smashing success, but while my fellow soldiers are content going back to base and celebrating our victory, I’m heading out on a new mission. Because the only time I feel alive now is when I fight. Revenge drove me. It’s all that ever drove me. But then I ended up killing my own father. And on top of that, it turns out the people I called my family were actually my enemies. What a goddamn joke, right? Anybody else laughing here?</p><p>When I return to reality, I see piles of corpses everywhere. It’s all my doing, this carnage, but instead of rage or sorrow, I just feel a strange sense of calm. Honestly, killing is the only thing that brings me peace anymore. Suddenly, an explosion shakes the ground—a close one. The sky turns red as flames arc up toward the heavens. As I stare at this crimson sky, my heart begins to race. I set out in search of someone to fight, hoping to calm my jangled nerves.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The war has turned in our favor. The enemies we don’t kill we send running into the night… But it still isn’t enough. I find myself picking my way across a viscera-strewn battlefield just in case we missed a straggler. After a bit, I sense someone hiding behind a collapsed house. Battle fever floods my senses. I raise my sword and leap out of hiding, prepared to strike down my terrible foe. But there, crouching on the ground, is a little girl.</p><p> I think.<br> I extend a bloody hand and grab the girl by the arm. She screams. I don’t care. I give her a good yank and start walking. She responds by pinwheeling her other arm and toppling face-down into the mud. That’s when I realize the kid is blind.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The girl, still sitting on the ground, grabs my hand and says,</p><p>“Oh no, mister! You’re bleeding. Are you okay?”</p><p>The question hits me wrong, and I smack her hand away. After that, we wait in a long, uncomfortable silence.</p><p>“It’s not my blood,” I say finally, as much to break the silence as anything else. I wipe my hand on my pants to clear off as much gore as I can, then help the kid up. Her hands are so damn<br>. I’d forgotten hands could be soft. The only thing mine are good for any more is murder; it’s hard to believe her hands and mine are the same thing.</p><p>With no other choice, I throw her across my back and start working my way back to base. I can feel the kid’s warmth against me. And there, in the strange silence you always get on a battlefield after a fight… The only thing I can hear is the beating of my own heart.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Eventually, we make it to a field hospital. It’s a nice place, actually, with sunlight coming through the windows and wind rustling the trees. The kid seems okay with it, at least. She lies on a bed, her gaze trained on the window to her side.</p><p>“Hey, kid,” I ask her.</p><p>“What were you doing on the ground back there?”</p><p>She pauses for a second, then speaks. She tells me how she’d been neglected by her parents her whole life before they finally abandoned her once the war came home.</p><p>When her story is done, she turns her head in my direction and asks:</p><p>“What color is the sky right now, mister?” I take a look out the window.</p><p>“Blue,” I say.</p><p>“A nice, deep blue.”</p><p>She closes her eyes—I have no idea why—and begins to try and imagine what<br> might look like. I don’t know why I feel uneasy here, but I do. Something about being near this kid puts me on edge. My heart is racing again—but in a different way than the discomfort I’ve felt for my entire life. And as I try to identify what this strange feeling is, I picture the color of the sky in the girl’s imagination.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>After he returned from battle</p><p>Cheers ring out from the dusty barracks. In a shift from the tense atmosphere on the eve of their operation, the soldiers now laugh easily with each other as they celebrate the great victory they have won.</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Golden ale flows freely and without formality of rank. The men drain glass after glass, scarcely noticing how much they are spilling in the process. Their unit had secured a miraculous victory, and this party is their reward. But they are drunk on more than ale this night; they took on an impossible mission and came back alive, and this fact alone makes their heads swim and their speech giddy. Men brag of their accomplishments in battle. They brag about the beauty of their wives. Every lip is loosened and free. Apparently some of the soldiers even earned promotions for their valor on the mission.</p><p>But inside this bright atmosphere, a single young soldier sits apart from the others with a glum look on his face. He had infiltrated the enemy base alone—against the orders of his direct commander—and slain the enemy captain. Though their victory was due in large part to this deed, his actions were still troubling. No matter how well it had turned out, he had ignored a direct order from a superior; a court-martial would be unsurprising. That he did so because of a personal grudge is perhaps the most troubling fact of all. By all rights, he should have died on that battlefield. But his life was saved by his fellow soldiers—and especially by the quick thinking and bravery of the very captain whose orders he was so quick to disregard.</p><p>Regardless, the boy sits alone, not bothering to thank the men around him or share a meal or drink. His mind is still back with the enemy commander. The same man who killed his parents so long ago. After years of chasing him, the boy had finally cornered his target and plunged his weapon into his heart, along with all of his hate. But the fall of the curtain on his revenge was hollow. He felt no exhilaration. No accomplishment. Instead, he was left with the empty bones of a past he could never reclaim. With that gloomy sadness filling the boy’s head, the dying enemy captain spoke to him. He told the boy something that turned everything he’d ever believed on its head. And now, he sits among his celebrating fellows and replays the words over and over again in his mind:</p><p>The secret of my birth. My past. My true father.<br> It is so farfetched as to stretch the bounds of credulity, and yet he is unable to set it aside.</p><p>The boy stares blankly into space. The drink in his hand has long since grown warm, but he pays it no mind. Suddenly, a brawny soldier approaches him. Ignoring his troubled state, he plops down beside him with a most inconsiderate thud. This man had always treated the boy harshly—more like an enemy than a fellow soldier in the ranks.</p><p>“You here to pick another fight?” asks the boy. He can’t even bother to lift his head for the query, feeling all the more gloomy from the man’s presence.</p><p>“Fight? No, boy. I’m damn proud of you.”</p><p>The boy is shocked to hear actual praise coming from the man. So shocked that he looks up in spite of himself. There’s a slight hint of envy in the words, as if the man wishes he had the guts to disobey orders and sneak off to kill the enemy. Regardless, the boy finds the compliment embarrassing. Quickly lowering his head to hide the flush on his cheeks, he stands and makes his way to the exit.</p><p>“Goin’ for a piss, there?” asks the brawny man. The boy gives a vague response and ducks outside.</p><p>Night has fallen on the land. The silence is so perfect—especially when compared to the chaos of the barracks—that it causes his ears to ring. Camaraderie and banter did not come easily to him by nature, but that is not the reason for his discomfort this night. He has so many things to think about. And here, in the dark, his thoughts are free to run rampant. He stands there for a long time, until a sound finally causes him to turn around. An injured soldier is behind him, leaning on a crutch. He looks at the boy and cuts straight to the point:</p><p>“So, what were you doing in the enemy camp?”</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The night had deepened, the surroundings now fully dark. Faint light streams out from the windows of the barracks. The soldiers inside were still busy drinking and boasting. But here, away from all the sound and bluster, two fellow soldiers face each other in silence. The boy studies his unexpected visitor. He is young, with strong features and a shock of blond hair. But his most noticeable characteristics are his blue eyes, which seem to shine with their own inner light. The boy usually pays no mind to the appearance of others, but even he remembered that distinguishing feature. He is one of the soldiers who received a promotion. Recalling that, the boy’s puzzlement only grows. Gazing upon the soldier before him, he thinks back on the question he was asked.</p><p>He asked me what I was doing in the base.</p><p>We’re not even particularly close, so why is he starting this conversation with me?</p><p>And why did he wait until we were alone to approach me?</p><p>“I can’t answer you unless I know why you’re asking.”</p><p>The blue-eyed soldier stares back at him.</p><p>Then, after a moment, he begins to tell his tale.</p><p>“We were part of the operation.”</p><p>“My squad arrived at the camp after you killed the commander.”</p><p>“The enemy was in total disarray, and we were able to dispatch the stragglers with relative ease.”</p><p>“Once that was done, we searched their camp.”</p><p>“And guess what I found?”</p><p>“A confidential file marked with the crest of<br>our<br> army.”</p><p>“Naturally, I was curious how this ended up in enemy hands, so I picked it up to take a closer look.”</p><p>“But before I could open it, someone attacked me from behind and knocked me unconscious.”</p><p>“When I woke up, the file was gone.”</p><p>“But here’s the thing: We neutralized the enemy soldiers—every last one of them. So who the hell attacked me?”</p><p>The boy starts.</p><p>“Are you saying<br>I<br> attacked you?”</p><p>The other soldier locks his blue eyes on the boy.</p><p>“That’s my guess, yeah.”</p><p>“I mean, you disobeyed orders, right? Infiltrated the camp and killed the commander all by your lonesome?”</p><p>“Even you have to admit that’s suspicious.”</p><p>“So I’ll ask you again: What were you doing in the enemy base?”</p><p>When the boy finally speaks again, he chooses his words carefully. He tells the blue-eyed soldier how his parents had been killed when he was young. How the killer was the enemy commander. How he became a soldier specifically to find that man and end his life. And how he didn’t care if he would end up court-martialed, because his revenge would be worth any price.</p><p>The blue-eyed soldier remains silent. It’s as if he’s trying to discern the truth in the boy’s words.</p><p>Silence settles between the two soldiers. In the quiet, the boy thinks about his comrade’s story.</p><p>He found one of our confidential files in the enemy base.</p><p>But before he could read it, someone attacked him and stole it.</p><p>Someone from our army.</p><p>Is that file related to what the enemy commander told me?</p><p>Does it relate to our country’s past? And does it hold the answers I need?</p><p>After a bit, the blue-eyed soldier nods and turns away, apparently satisfied that the boy is innocent.</p><p>“Wait!” cries the boy.</p><p>The man stops.</p><p>“What happened to the file?”</p><p>“Well, if my suspicions are correct and it was taken by one of us, it should be in the vault here at the base.”</p><p>He then turns back to the boy and adds:</p><p>“But don’t go getting any stupid ideas.”</p><p>“You already disobeyed orders once, and it won’t go well if you do it again. So just keep your head down, okay?”</p><p>He then departs, limping away on his crutch. But his warning falls on deaf ears. For the boy would do anything to know what is in that file.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Why did he tell me that story in the first place?</p><p>He clearly thinks we have a traitor in our midst.</p><p>He made contact in hopes of finding out who it is, so maybe we can form a partnership and…</p><p>The boy lets this thought marinate in his mind for a bit before suddenly rejecting it. If the file<br>does<br> contain the secret of his birth, he doesn’t want anyone else knowing about it. He begins to formulate a plan. The blue-eyed soldier is likely correct: If the file was stolen by a traitor, it would be located in the vault.</p><p>Their base is a large, sprawling complex with many buildings. There are barracks, a training ground, a reference library… And the vault, which is only accessible to a select group of people. Now in the library, the boy finds himself staring at a set of blueprints for the base. Coated in dust and weathered away to a dim yellow color, they seem ready to fall apart in his hands. But he finds the part he wants, carefully tears it away, and quickly sidles out of the room. It is the route to the vault.</p><p>The boy makes his way to the changing room. But not to don a disguise. Instead, he climbs on top of a locker and removes a dusty wire panel covering an exhaust duct. A duct that leads to the vault. He always cursed his small physique, but is now thrilled to have it. Drawing his shoulders tight, he manages to squeeze inside. Holding his flashlight between his cheek and his shoulder, he wriggles his way forward like an inchworm. Every movement brings a new puff of dust or a cobweb brushing against his face. He struggles desperately against the urge to cough. But just as he is about to lose hope……he arrives at his destination. According to the blueprints, the vault is directly below him. With a sigh of relief, he reaches out to the wire panel. But he can’t get it free. Anger suddenly races through him, and he makes a rash decision.</p><p>Applying all of his strength to it, he shoves the panel until it breaks apart with a crack loud enough to wake the dead. The boy scans the inside of the vault, certain that he has alerted a guard or triggered some kind of alarm. The only source of light is a dimly illuminated exit sign.</p><p>When no one comes to investigate, the boy lets out a sigh of relief. Wiping a bit of sweat from his brow, he lowers himself down. The vault is filled with row after row of metal shelves. Each shelf has a number, with contents organized by date and type, such as confidential documents or artifacts claimed from the enemy. The boy roams through the rows, shining his light here and there. He checks dates on the confiscated items and opens any file that seems like it might be relevant to his interests. Finally, he stumbles across a folder with the word “Confidential” stamped across it.</p><p>It also contains the seal of their army. Just like the one from the other soldier’s tale.</p><p>The boy takes a deep breath and opens it. The words inside immediately draw his eye:</p><p>“INFANT ABDUCTION STRATEGY”</p><p>His heart begins to race. With a single trembling finger, he reaches out and slowly turns the page.<br>It is a complete accounting of his country’s actions. The plan was designed to create powerful soldiers. They researched genes from people across the world, looking for those with the traits they sought. Before long, they had a pool of possible recruits. Once an infant was found from a desired genetic line, they were kidnapped and raised as one of their own citizens. Everything the enemy commander had told him was true. And with each line he reads, the boy’s long-held beliefs collapse. It is a pain unlike anything he has ever felt.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Here, in the darkest part of his nation, the boy has uncovered the harshest of truths.</p><p>The file. The vault. His history. The “Infant Abduction Strategy.” The words of his hated enemy.</p><p>The words on the page. It was all coming together. His head reels. His chest tightens. He feels like he is about to faint.</p><p>But he does not. More precisely, he<br>will<br> not. Because he had to avoid the blade of the knife that is racing up behind him. Perhaps it is the boy’s natural instincts that warn him; perhaps the superior genes that were mentioned in the file. Regardless, he twists his head to the side and narrowly avoids having it separated from his shoulders. The weapon is a military-issue combat knife. His attacker is a man in a mask. A thin ribbon of blood oozes down his neck where the knife had brushed it. Though the boy does not understand what is happening, his training takes over and he readies himself for a fight. His attacker had hoped to kill the boy from behind, which meant his plan was already falling apart. Taking advantage of this brief lapse, the boy twists to the side and spins around to face his attacker. He grabs his arm by the elbow and wrist, locking it in place. Then he shoves the man into a nearby wall and tears off his mask.</p><p>To reveal… A pair of beautiful blue eyes. The boy is stunned for the briefest of moments. But it is enough. The attacker twists his arm from the boy’s grasp and backs away from him.</p><p>“Well, that was damn unlucky,” says the man.</p><p>“Or maybe you’re just better than I thought.”</p><p>“Also, I thought I told you not to get any stupid ideas.”</p><p>It was true: the man had given him a warning. But the boy had ignored it, and now they were facing off once more. This time, there would be no talk. No parley. Instead, only one of them would leave the vault alive. The blue-eyed soldier snarls at the boy. It is a sound of anger, sadness, and indecision.</p><p>“Do you think I WANTED to do this!?”</p><p>“You think I WANTED to stab a fellow soldier in the back!?”</p><p>The blue-eyed man then tells the boy a shocking truth: The chatter at the party about the “blue-eyed guy being promoted” was based on a lie. He had actually been transferred to the national intelligence corps. There, he was ordered to feign injury while eliminating anyone who might threaten state secrets. One of those targets was the boy, who had attracted attention when he ignored orders and entered the enemy camp alone. His superiors ordered him to test the boy by revealing confidential information in order to see where his true loyalties lay.</p><p>“Goddammit,” breathes the man when his tale is done.</p><p>“GODDAMMIT!”</p><p>His emotions take hold, and he lunges at the boy. But the younger soldier calmly dodges the blow and takes a couple of steps back, waiting for an opportunity to deploy the small knife he has hidden on his person.</p><p>You came here expecting prey,<br> thinks the boy.<br>But in the end, I am the one hunting you.</p><p>The man screams and lunges at the boy again, but the attack is sloppy and easily dodged. As his foe lumbers past, the boy pulls his knife from its sheath and draws it across the man’s throat. The blue-eyed man falls to his knees, gasping. He presses his hands against his throat, but the blood simply courses through his fingers. As his heartbeat slows, he leans against a wall and slowly slumps to the floor. The light in his beautiful blue eyes dims. The boy gazes into them quietly.</p><p>He does so for a very long time. When he finally comes back to reality, the man is no longer breathing. Sheets of paper from the file are scattered at his feet. He picks up one blood-soaked page and looks it over. It is a list of all the children who had been abducted. The plan had been in place for some time, long enough that many of his superiors and fellow soldiers were likely victims of it. They had been stolen from other countries, incorporated into a new nation, and given fake lives—just as he had been. Unable to collect his chaotic thoughts, he finds himself presented with a cruel truth: By killing a man who was supposed to be on his side, he finds himself with nothing left to trust. Not his country, not his fellow soldiers, and not even himself.</p><p>Anger. Sadness. Unease. Fear. Hate.</p><p>All these emotions swirl and churn in his heart.</p><p>“So then… What should I live for?”</p><p>The words that spill from his quivering lips are quickly swallowed up by the darkness.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>The summer night swelters. The air is still. A roar of flame climbs over the darkened suburbs and into the starry sky.</p><p>The labor camp beyond the barbed wire burns.</p><p>An alarm signals an emergency.</p><p>“We’re under attack!” cry the guards.</p><p>The workers’ footsteps become a frenzied pounding as they seek escape. The sudden fires throw the inside of the building into chaos. A small girl of meager years races down the burning corridor, her wails echoing off the walls.</p><p>“Quickly! This way!”</p><p>A guard grabs her hand and attempts to pull her away. His plan is to take the sobbing girl away from the fire and outside to safety. But instead, she looks up with frightened eyes and digs her heels in tight. Her response is understandable. For she is a worker at the camp. Her life has been a litany of abuses at the hands of the military, including guards like him. So when he grabs her hand, her fear instinct kicks in, and she is unable to move.</p><p>His irritation rising, the guard raises his voice.</p><p>“Do as I say, girl! Take advantage of the chaos and get out of—“</p><p>His words grind to a halt. The girl stares at the blade that now protrudes from his chest. Someone has stabbed him from behind with a rapier.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The guard musters what remains of his hate to turn and face the figure behind him. It is a slim young man with silver hair. In his fading consciousness, the guard recalls a wanted poster he has seen countless times. It showed the image of the young man who now stands before him; of this there is no doubt. The army has been searching for him, for he leads a group of insurgents who attack labor camps such as this. And it is him and his people who caused this chaos.</p><p>The bloodied blade slides from the guard’s body. His corpse slips into a puddle of blood on the ground.</p><p>“Nnngh…”</p><p>The girl trembles to see the tragic sight before her. Her legs are heavy weights. The young man wipes his bloody blade on the fallen guard’s clothes before turning his attention to the girl.</p><p>“Come on. We’re getting out of here.”</p><p>There is one reason he and his comrades attack the army’s forced-labor camps:</p><p>They seek to free children captured by the Infant Abduction Strategy and absorb them into their ranks.</p><p>The Infant Abduction Strategy.</p><p>It is a secret operation in which this country’s army kidnaps genetically superior children from foreign countries and trains them to be soldiers. Those who prove ill-suited for warfare are instead thrown into labor camps. The young man was abducted as part of this operation. And though he fought for his new country for a short time, he deserted once he learned the truth of his background. Now, he attacks their camps alongside those who are also fueled by a desire for revenge, freeing the laborers before taking them in as companions.</p><p>One day, he will find and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the man who tore him from his parents and made his life a misery. But in order to accomplish this task, he needs fighters of his own.</p><p>A dozen or so of his people wait for him outside the burning camp. The children who had been working there gather around them. As the young man sends the girl over to the others, one of his compatriots—a man with freckles—offers a report:</p><p>“He’s still not back.”</p><p>He<br> is one of their fellows who often acts outside of orders.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>Unable to hide his irritation, the young man clicks his tongue.</p><p>“What’s the plan?” asked the freckled man.</p><p>Even if they decide to launch a search, the camp is engulfed in flame. And while they are safe at the moment, enemy reinforcements are surely on the way. But…</p><p>“Take the kids and get out of here. I’ll catch up.”</p><p>There is no hesitation in the young man’s voice. Once he finishes speaking, he steps back inside the burning camp. Flames billow in every corner. Superheated air burns in his lungs. But the young man with silver hair continues to search for his compatriot—and at last, he finds him.</p><p>A boy sits on the ground, his back leaning against the wall. His pitch-black hair—a rare feature in this part of the world—shines brightly in the light of the billowing flames. He has taken a gunshot wound to his leg—but though it has rendered him immobile, it does not appear fatal. The young man sighs in relief before offering a cutting remark:</p><p>“Pretty sure this wasn’t where I ordered you to be.”</p><p>“I’m not apologizing.”</p><p>The black-haired boy is defiant. His gaze drops to the dead soldiers scattered on the ground around him.</p><p>“I don’t care about saving kids; I just want to kill as many of these bastards as I can.”</p><p>After being taken through the Infant Abduction Strategy, the boy was deemed ill-suited for combat and sent to a labor camp. He now harbors a deep hatred for the soldiers that abused him. As his leader, the young man finds this desire for revenge to be the height of selfishness. But he reprimands the boy no further. Instead, he slings him over his shoulders and silently moves back up the flaming corridor.</p><p>Eventually, he manages four words:</p><p>“I’m glad you survived.”</p><p>They fall from his mouth without warning. The young man understands why his subordinate acts as he does. When he was part of the army, he also made the same mistakes over and over in an attempt to avenge his parents. And every time, it was his captain and squadmates who pulled him from the fire.</p><p>The black-haired boy reminds the young man<br>so<br> much of his earlier self. And when he thinks of it that way, he finds he cannot abandon him to fate.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>When he was yet small, the young man’s parents were killed by an enemy army, after which he became a soldier so he might avenge them.</p><p>But…</p><p>Once his revenge was complete, he was forced to face an empty truth:</p><p>Those he believed were his parents were actually not. They were merely a couple attempting to raise a kidnapped child into the perfect soldier.</p><p>And…</p><p>The person he killed to avenge his parents was his true father.</p><p>On that day, he found his resolve. He would seek out and kill the man who devised the Infant Abduction Strategy. The top-secret military operation that had ruined his life. So he gathered people who harbored the same resentment, a group that grew more powerful by the day. They made their headquarters in a corner of a destitute area, acting as a kind of vigilante group in the region.</p><p>Violence had once been a staple of life in the area, but since the young man and his group arrived, it had grown safe enough for children to play outdoors.</p><p>But…</p><p>Today, things are different. A symphony of gunshots and heavy bootheels fills the air. The young man’s compatriots fall in a hail of bullets, their bodies trampled without mercy. Innocent villagers are caught in the crossfire. The group has attacked so many labor camps that the enemy army was finally able to locate their headquarters. As the young man shouts orders in an attempt to repel the siege, the gears in his head continue to turn.</p><p>The enemy had marched right into their stronghold without activating any traps or setting off even a single alarm. Even the best-trained soldiers could not accomplish such a feat. It’s as if they knew exactly where to step. Is it possible? Could someone on the inside be providing them intelligence?</p><p>As doubt scrambles for purchase in the young man’s heart, he shakes his head. Everyone on his side fights for the same objective; none would ever do such a thing. He shouts another order and draws his sword. As he does, the freckled man rushes to his side.</p><p>“I’ll hold them off,” he says. “Take any who can still fight and get out of here.”</p><p>The young man opens his mouth, thinking to reject the man’s proposed course of action. But he falters under the man’s straightforward gaze. The freckled man continues:</p><p>“We need you to live.”</p><p>His eyes bear down on the young man with determination and confidence. He will entrust all that is left to him so he might accomplish their mission: revenge on those who ruined their lives with the Infant Abduction Strategy.</p><p>And…</p><p>He could not find it in his heart to betray the resolve of his compatriots. That is the answer the young man arrived at.</p><p>He takes any who can still move and escapes the burning stronghold. Dawn is still a distant dream. The remaining dozen or so fighters sit together in a remote ruin and speak of what is to come. They have somehow evaded any pursuers along the way. But the army knows the direction in which they took flight, so they cannot escape them for long. And yet, the young man can’t let the responsibility he has been entrusted with go to waste.</p><p>“We need to kill the man in charge of the Infant Abduction Strategy before we’re found. Only then will our revenge be complete.”</p><p>They know their target is stationed in a domestic military facility. The young man produces a sketched set of facility blueprints they obtained for just this moment, then begins laying our their plan in a hoarse voice. The remaining dozen or so fighters will infiltrate the facility and kill key military personnel. It is a plan most reckless. But if they are going to be tracked down and cornered anyway, fighting is a better option than running. Or at least, that’s how the young man sees it.</p><p>“I’m not asking you to come with me,” he continues. “I want as many of you to survive as—“</p><p>“I’m going.”</p><p>Who interrupts, other than the black-haired boy? The one who acts of his own accord; the one who has caused the young man no end of grief.</p><p>“I didn’t stick with you all this time to<br>survive<br>,” says the boy. “I did it for revenge.”</p><p>When he speaks, the rest nod in determination before raising their voices in support of the plan. And though the young man has nowhere left to turn, he at least has his comrades. Dawn breaks. Faint light flickers in through rural foliage. The silver-haired young man and black-haired boy patrol the area around the ruins in which they hide. Suddenly, the boy comes to a halt, staring up at the vanishing stars. The gruff air he typically carries has faded into the shadows.</p><p>“If we fail, we’ll die,” he murmurs.</p><p>“Pretty much,” replies the young man.</p><p>“But what happens if we succeed?”</p><p>The boy levels his gaze on the young man.</p><p>“I’ve always wondered that: How am I supposed to live once I have my revenge?”</p><p>The young man has no answer. At first, he lived to exact revenge on the foreign soldier who killed his parents, only to learn the man was actually his real father. Since that day, he has lived for revenge on those who kidnapped him as a part of the Infant Abduction Strategy. That thought alone carries him through the endless days of fighting. Now that he thinks about it, vengeance has been his<br>entire<br> reason for living. He has forgotten what it is like to live without it.</p><p>“We’ll figure it out once it’s over,” says the young man finally. “Until then, we just need to survive.”</p><p>The black-haired boy gives a sad smile unlike his typical brusque self.</p><p>And…</p><p>The young man returns from patrol and falls into his bunk. When he wakes up, he finds the boy gone. All that remains are his belongings. They search his bag and find a single piece of paper. Written on it is the day’s temperature and weather, as well as a description of the townsfolk. The boy’s comrades tilt their head at the nonsensical letter. Why has he left this? But the young man understands.</p><p>“It’s a code.”</p><p>It is terribly similar to one the military uses, which means they cannot decipher it without a matching decoder. But the question the young man had is now solved. The army had known exactly what to expect when they attacked, and that was most certainly due to…</p><p>The young man decides to accept his betrayal.</p><p>But…<br>He remembers how sad the boy’s smile was at dawn. The image is seared into his mind. He will never forget it.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The young man wades through waist-deep water along with a dozen or so of his compatriots.</p><p>In the dead of night, they are making their way through a sewer. It connects to a canal that surrounds the military facility, and is the optimal path for sneaking in while avoiding detection.</p><p>Their destination is the facility’s control room. The man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the program that took them from their homelands and ruined their lives—should be waiting there. They will kill him, and in doing so have their revenge. That is their plan.</p><p>The sewers are silent, save for the occasional ripple of disturbed water. The enemy does not seem to know they are there. But they all know that is likely not the case, and so proceed with the utmost caution. The black-haired boy always acted on his own accord. He left proof he had been working with the enemy before vanishing from the group. But before he did so, they informed him of their plan to infiltrate the facility. Though the young man changed the date, time, and route of the operation, it is likely the black-haired boy told the army enough for them to be on alert. This will doubtless be the most difficult of fights.</p><p>At last, they arrive at a ladder leading to the surface. The young man turns to his allies and speaks in a heavy tone. He tells them there is one thing he has to do before killing the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. He must find the boy who vanished after leaving proof of his betrayal and ask him<br>why<br>.</p><p>The young man continues:</p><p>“If he really was communicating with the enemy, he wouldn’t have left proof for us to find.”</p><p>“I saw in his eyes how much he hated our enemy. None of that was false.”</p><p>Even now, he trusts the black-haired boy. For he is just as reckless as the young man used to be. The young man knows his request to find the boy is selfish; they don’t even know if he is in the facility at all.</p><p>“Anyway, I won’t ask any of you come with me,” concludes the young man as he casts his gaze downward. The rest of his group chuckles.</p><p>“We’ve always known how selfish you are, yet we chose to stick by your side. We burn with the same need for revenge as you, yet we also know the boy wouldn’t betray us without some reason.”</p><p>These are their words. While the need for revenge may be the warped strand that keeps their group together, they also have a firm bond of trust.</p><p>“Thank you,” says the young man.</p><p>Together, they climb the ladder and move into the base. The group had steeled themselves for a battle against uncountable enemy soldiers, but security is unnaturally lax.</p><p>“They’ll be here any second! Send out the patrols and ready for a counterattack!”</p><p>Hearing enemy soldiers yelling orders, the group freezes in place and attempts to get a better idea of what is happening.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Intruders! Intru—“</p><p>The guard’s voice suddenly cuts off of amidst a burst of gunfire. The group has no idea what is happening, which makes the situation all the more dangerous. Yet they have no choice but to take advantage of the chaos and act. They carve a path with blade and bullet, proceeding through the base in search of the black-haired boy. Their destination is the control room, where the young man feels certain he will be found.</p><p>His trust in the boy has not wavered; not even when presented with proof of his betrayal. His heart is bound not by logic, but by faith, and it now tells him where to go.</p><p>And then…</p><p>As the group nears the control room, their eyes widen at the terrible sight before them. Bodies of dead soldiers lie scattered across the quiet hallway. Bullet holes scar the walls around them. The young man has an awful feeling in his gut. His heart pounds in his ears. He takes a moment to calm his breathing, then begins to follow the trail of blood.</p><p>Silence hangs heavily around them. Not a single guard stands watch outside the control room—the place where the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy should be. At a wordless signal from the young man, his companions batter down the door.</p><p>But…</p><p>The room is silent. There is no sign of the enemy leader they are looking for. Instead, there is someone else lying on the floor. His black hair is matted with blood. Breath rattles in his chest as life slowly abandons him. The young man’s eyes widen. As one, the group breaks into a dash and rushes over to the boy.</p><p>“H-hey, boss…”</p><p>The corner of the boy’s mouth, thick with blood, quirks upward in a half-smile. The young man crouches down and tells him not to speak. As he inspects his wounds, his mind whirls, wondering if there is a way to save him. But his body is riddled with bullets; everyone can see his time is nearly gone. The boy croaks out a hoarse voice, apologizing for his actions before attempting to explain.</p><p>The enemy had approached him, offering to put him in contact with his real parents if he turned traitor. But when the army invaded the destitute district and began slaughtering people indiscriminately, he immediately regretted his decision. So he turned his coat again, using his position as their mole to infiltrate the facility and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. It…did not go well.</p><p>As the young man listens to this tale of regret, a thought comes to him: Perhaps they should not forgive the boy for divulging information to the enemy.</p><p>But…</p><p>Would he have done differently in his place? The young man is not so sure. Can he blame the boy for being led astray because of a desire to find happiness with his family?</p><p>“It’s fine,” says the young man. “Don’t worry. I’ll finish the job.”</p><p>“Thanks… And maybe one day…”</p><p>A melancholy smile spreads across the black-haired boy’s face.</p><p>“You can tell me what comes after revenge…”</p><p>His words stop. He lies still. The young man watches as his life ends, then quietly gets to his feet. They must keep going. Vengeance will not wait. The boy has killed the guards and plunged the facility into chaos.

And though he ultimately perished… His compatriots and allies followed the path he carved and successfully reached the core of the facility.</p><p>Now, they continue searching for the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. An inhumane project wherein the country kidnaps children from neighboring lands to raise as either soldiers or laborers. The boy and his companions are victims of this operation, and their goal is to kill this man and get their revenge.</p><p>Dawn approaches. At the gate behind the facility, several shadowy figures mill about in the dark.</p><p>“Why aren’t the damned reinforcements here yet!?”</p><p>The man who cursed wears a uniform decorated with several medals. He is the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy, and he now runs a nervous hand through his long beard. Unable to hide his irritation in the face of his guards’ failure, he is resorting to chewing out his subordinates.</p><p>“The reinforcements will be here in less than ten minutes, sir,” one of his personal retinue tells him. He gestures to a waiting car, inviting the man inside. They will ferry him away to a safe place until the commotion dies down.</p><p>But…</p><p>Gunshots ring out. Bullets pierce the guards’ heads, sending blood flying. The man realizes what is going on, but by the time he attempts to make his escape, it is far too late. The thin blade of a rapier suddenly pierces his neck from behind, its steel shimmering in the pale light of night. The man feels cold spreading across his body, as well as fear of his upcoming demise.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of a young man whispers low in his ear:</p><p>“You have no right to mourn your death; my friends all faced more gruesome ends because of you.”</p><p>He then begins to speak of all of the lives he’s seen ruined because of the Infant Abduction Strategy. The children who grew into soldiers, forever ignorant of their pasts. Those children locked in dark, cramped rooms and forced to labor until their last breath. And those who learned of the top-secret operation and met their ends as a result.</p><p>As the boy quakes with fury, the man attempts to articulate an apology. But the boy cuts him off.</p><p>“Not to me. Apologize to the dead.”</p><p>And with that, the man’s light goes out forever. The young man has found his revenge, but in so doing has lost his path home. The rest of his allies had volunteered to hold off the enemy and catch up later, granting the young man a path to vengeance. But none of them have arrived. Instead, all that follows the young man as he flees are reinforcements sent by the military.</p><p>Several hours have passed since he escaped the facility. The sky lightens, the sun gradually starting to show its face. Though the young man hid every time he encountered the enemy, he has taken numerous bullets, and his body now nears its end.</p><p>He rests on his knees, alone in the shade of a building. The blood that flees his body reddens the ground as it greets the dawn. As the young man sits beneath the rising sun, he feels his consciousness fade.</p><p>And yet, he does not mind such an end.</p><p>His revenge is complete.</p><p>It is all over.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>………………</p><p>“I’m glad you survived.”</p><p>There comes a voice from the darkness. It is an old voice, one he heard many times in the past, and one that comes with many memories. It is then he realizes: Though he cannot move and his vision is clouding, he still<br>lives<br>.</p><p>Off in the distance, he sees a small light. In the light, people wave.</p><p>They are…</p><p>His parents: the ones who raised him, despite being part of a plot.</p><p>His real father: the one he killed with his own hands.</p><p>His real mother: the one who brought him into this world.</p><p>His squadmates: the ones for whom he caused so much trouble, yet who forgave him all the same.</p><p>His compatriots: the ones who believed in him and led him to this point.</p><p>It is then that he remembers.</p><p>We need you to live.</p><p>His allies had risked their lives to ensure his survival. He cannot forget this. They have entrusted so much to his care, and he has somehow survived this long.</p><p>And…</p><p>Maybe one day, you can tell me what comes after revenge…</p><p>He must fulfill his promise to the black-haired boy.</p><p>And that</p><p>is why</p><p>he can’t</p><p>die just yet.</p><p>But…</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>………………</p><p>Earlier this summer, fifteen boys launched a revolt against a military facility. Their objective was to kill the man behind the Infant Abduction Strategy. And while they accomplished their objective, reports claim they paid for it with their lives. The Infant Abduction Strategy was the military’s best-kept secret—its existence unknown to all but a few in power—and they attempted to clean it up in secret.</p><p>However, one soldier blew the whistle on the inhumane methods of the operation, and was quickly labeled a hero. As a result, the vice-like grip the military once held over the government is now in decline.</p><p>And now…</p><p>A lonely young man walks atop an abandoned railroad, flanked on either side by rows of sunflowers. His body is scarred with signs of battle; he had once been so consumed by vengeance that he became a soldier.</p><p>He is the one who led the revolt. Reports claim all the children involved in the incident had perished. But he alone had been saved by a hero. He alone survived. He walks along the old railroad. He walks by himself, no blade or pistol at his hip, in search of what comes after revenge.</p><p>This is his path.</p><p>Summer is coming to an end.</p><p>A cool breeze dances among the flowers.<br>As though gently encouraging him forward.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Sweltering Bonds<br>[<br>]</p><p>I walk along a dilapidated railroad lined by endless fields of sunflowers. High above, an uncaring sun rages against a brilliant blue sky, turning the rows of blossoms into paint-smeared streaks of yellow.</p><p>Oh, how I hate it all.</p><p>Time is an illusion here. Hunger a constant companion. My steps fall one after the other after the other, until I finally see a tunnel begin to materialize in the heat-shimmer distance. And on the other side of it, a foreign city.</p><p>This country used to kidnap children in an effort to improve its gene pool, you see. And while the victims were spirited from countries across the world, the majority came from the city at the other end of this tunnel—the city that is my true home. And that is why I walk through the pain and the smells and the hunger and the heat: in the hope it all somehow leads me to the truth.</p><p>A woman stands at the tunnel entrance. She’s maybe in her mid-40s, with a staff in her hand. Her steely eyes stare unblinkingly at the sunflowers, but as I attempt to slip past, she spins around and whips a blade out of the top of her staff. I manage to block it with my own, and we stand there a moment, frozen in time.</p><p>“What business does a soldier have in a place like this?” she asks, ire in her voice. “I know that sword you hold. It took the lives of countless numbers of my countrymen.”</p><p>In truth, I’d brought the sword with me when I deserted the army, which is why it has a military insignia on the scabbard. To me, it’s just a weapon—but to this woman, it is the sign of her most hated enemy.</p><p>“Found it on the ground,” I say casually. Clearly unconvinced by my answer, she makes her move. Our blades begin to ring back and forth in a blur of iron and steel. Her blows are relentless, her strength otherworldly. Any advantage I may have had is long gone, and as I desperately attempt to fend her off, she lands a firm blow on the pit of my stomach, crumpling me to the ground.</p><p>The woman looms over me, blocking out that brilliant blue sky. She raises her blade above her head and prepares to claim my life, but before she can act, another voice calls out from inside the tunnel.</p><p>“Captain! Enemy approaching!”</p><p>An enemy attack? No. Oh, no.</p><p>As my attacker lowers her weapon and turns to face this new threat, I manage to tilt my head toward the disturbance. It’s a squadron of soldiers all dressed in the familiar uniform of my old intel corps. Were they here for<br>me<br>? Did they really follow me all the way out here?</p><p>“Beat them back!” cries the captain. “Do not let them touch the sunflowers!”</p><p>On her command, armed villagers pour out of the tunnel and begin battling my old companions. They fight well, these commoners—better than I would have expected. But before I can see more, the pain of my wounds floods through me, turning the sounds of gunfire and screams into the hush of distant rain on a windowpane before fading out altogether.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Sunflower Child<br>[<br>]</p><p>“You don’t have much of a talent for housework, I see.”</p><p>This scolding comes as I sweep the living room, and I turn to see the owner of this house: the same captain who attacked me on the railroad two days prior. She was permitting me to stay in a spare room by way of apology for injuring me—which would have been a kinder gesture had she not also demanded that I clean and run errands to pay for room and board.</p><p>“I’m leaving for patrol. Make sure you clean every inch of this place. Got it?”</p><p>This border city lives in constant danger of invasion, and the captain leads a militia that helps to keep it safe. She apparently attacked me because she thought I was the enemy—a mistake put to rights the moment she saw my former intel companions arrive and attempt to kill me. Regardless, I’ve had enough of this arrangement; I’m going to leave this house tonight if it’s the last thing I do. But as I whip the broom around and send dust flying through the air, the air is split by a sudden thunder so loud it almost tears my ears from their moorings.</p><p>Shaking the cobwebs free, I rush to a nearby window and see a cannon firing a giant ball of water high into the sky. The unusual missile flies through the air and tunnel before bursting apart and showing the fields of sunflowers on either side of the railroad tracks. The droplets glitter as they fall through the blue, and I find myself utterly entranced by the sight.</p><p>“We lost so many children,” murmurs the captain behind me.</p><p>“So many stolen from us. We planted a sunflower for every one of them.”</p><p>As she says this, I realize one of those flowers was planted for me. On the heels of that, I suddenly imagine a man looking at the flowers and thinking of his kidnapped child. He’s a soldier—the same one I killed to take revenge for my family. But in truth, the parents I had cared for and loved so dearly were the same people who kidnapped me from my home all those years ago. And the other man? The one I killed for revenge?</p><p>Well, he was my true father.</p><p>“So many of us are still waiting for their sunflowers to come home. Even now. Even still.”</p><p>The woman’s voice brings me back to reality, but I don’t want to see the shadow I know is clouding her eyes. So instead of replying, I look away—because I don’t have the time or patience to deal with such nonsense.</p><p>When midnight arrives, I gather my things and leave the house. My injuries were manageable, and I’d had more than my share of chores—but more importantly, I wanted to learn more about the abductions. After walking for a while, I come to one of the city’s main avenues and spy the captain hurrying along with a lantern in her hand.</p><p>My curiosity piqued, I hide in the shadows and follow the bouncing glow of her lamp until we arrive at the other side of the tunnel, where she walks over to a sunflower and begins to whisper to herself. But the night is still, and her hush carries to my position. It’s a name—the same name, said in a rush over and over and over again.</p><p>I take a step backward.</p><p>Two.</p><p>I don’t want to believe what I’m hearing, but my ears do not lie. Because the name the captain is repeating to the uncaring night?</p><p>It’s mine.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Sin’s Shadow<br>[<br>]</p><p>I set the bucket down next to the cannon and attempt to stretch the cricks out of my back. Every morning, this cannon fires water across the sky and over the sunflowers that stand sentinel at the entrance to the city. But all that water doesn’t carry itself, so it’s the job of the town militia to fill the buckets and carry them up and down, up and down, over and over again. And as the newest member of the militia, I’m now achingly familiar with exactly how lousy the job is.</p><p>“Thanks for the help, new guy,” says a brawny man as he picks up my bucket. He dumps it into the cannon with a practiced hand, then turns to me and smiles.</p><p>“This might get loud.”</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion rings out, sending a sphere of water flying towards the edge of the city. As I look down from the platform upon which we’re perched, I see children playing on an abandoned train car; they look up and cheer with delight as the orb soars overhead.</p><p>“Captain started this whole cannon business six months ago,” says my burly companion as we wipes sweat from his forehead. “Thought she was nuts at first, but now it’s the highlight of everyone’s day. Go figure.”</p><p>“Well, I still think it’s nuts. Haven’t you people ever heard of a hose?”</p><p>The other man grins. “This ain’t about being efficient; Captain wants to prove that weapons can be used for more than just killing. Came up with the idea right around the time her husband dies in battle, so maybe that’s where it came from.”</p><p>The captain’s husband? He was my real father—and the very man I killed. But I can’t let on to this, so I give a vague mumble in reply and climb down from the observation deck. There’s still plenty of work to be done, after all.</p><p>In the afternoon, I head to the market with the captain to purchase items for soldiers who’ve been injured in battle. Once we pick up whatever they need, we’ll bring it to them ourselves. Between hauling water and playing delivery boy, this is easily the most boring militia I’ve ever heard of—and yet, I find myself sticking around.</p><p>“I’ve got this one,” I say, taking a package from the captain’s hands.</p><p>“I don’t need your help,” she says sternly before breaking out into the smile that I’d started seeing more and more over the past few weeks. “But…I appreciate it.”</p><p>Later, we arrive at the soldiers’ homes with the provisions. The captain hands them over and engages with each and every person in conversation. I’ve never been much for idle chit-chat, so I pass the time by loitering in the yard.</p><p>After several such visits, we come to a house where she stays inside much longer than usual. From where I stand, it seems to be a conversation between friends; the patter is rapid, and I hear frequent peals of laughter from the pair of them.</p><p>After waiting around for what I consider to be a generous period of time, I finally lose my patience and storm into the house to hurry things along. But when my eyes lock onto the other person in the room—a man with a prosthetic leg—the laughter suddenly stops. The joy and color drains from the man’s face as an ominous mood settles over the room.</p><p>“YOU!” cries the man. With a speed that belies his injury, he leaps from the couch, tackles me to the floor, and wraps his hand around my throat. “I’ll never forget you! Never! NEVER!”</p><p>“Stop it! Get off him!”</p><p>The captain wraps her arms around the man and yanks him off me as he continues to protest. I want to tell him to stop—I want to<br>scream.<br> But my breath has abandoned me, and all I can do is pray that it returns.</p><p>“He’s the one, Captain! He’s the enemy soldier who killed your husband!”</p><p>Silence. Deafening. Eternal.</p><p>“Is this true?” asks the captain with a trembling voice. I want to respond, but my body is shaking too hard. I’ve never been this scared—not in any battle, not from any man. The silence grows and thickens until it feels like it will smother the life out of the three of us and leave nothing behind but dust.</p><p>“Get out of here. Leave. I don’t ever want to see your face again.”</p><p>I start to stammer something—some pathetic explanation—but she turns to me with blade in hand, just as she did the first day we met. Yet the look in her eyes is much fiercer that it was then; a wild thing that shows a person on the edge of losing everything that might possibly make her human.</p><p>“NOW!”</p><p>My quivering legs somehow propel me out of the house and through the streets of town. I curse my stupidity as I run, bemoaning how I’d stayed with the captain in some pathetic attempt to repent for how I’d torn her life apart. But here’s the funny thing: I actually thought I could do it. I actually thought I might be able to make amends.</p><p>Ah, but that was the wish of a fool.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Midnight Flames<br>[<br>]</p><p>I urge myself forward.</p><p>One more step and my ragged breath echoes in the dark. One more step and my lungs burn pure fire. One more step. One more step. One more step.</p><p>“I don’t ever want to see your face again.”</p><p>The Captain’s words play in my brain without pause, which is why I’d originally planned to never return to the city after the night I abandoned it three months prior. But then I learned it had fallen into enemy hands, so now I am running back, running with everything I have, all so I might reach a woman who wants nothing more than to never see me again.</p><p>I finally reach the city’s rear gates and step through. Taking a deep breath, I look around, my eyes scarcely able to process what they see.</p><p>The hardy merchants who kept trading despite short supplies. The disciplined members of the militia. The children who loved to play in the abandoned train cars. All the people who once made the city a living, breathing thing are now charred corpses smoking on the ground. The world is silent and still, save for the occasional gust of wind and the uncaring crackle of flame.</p><p>Eventually, I discover the body of the brawny militia member in the rubble of what remains of the cannon. The pungent scent of gunpowder is still strong, even through it was now used to fire water. As I press on, I find only death. A familiar face here, a name on the wind there. But what I cannot seem to find is the body of the Captain—the very reason I came back in the first place.</p><p>Could it be? Is it possible?</p><p>Instinct quickly bubbles into outright conviction, and I set off at a run for the sunflowers she loved above all things. But when I emerge on the other side of the tunnel, I’m horrified to find the fields ablaze, the flowers transformed into an endless river of fire under the dark night sky. Against their light, I finally see a familiar figure lying on the tracks.</p><p>I race to the Captain’s side and take an involuntary step back, aghast. Her body is an ocean of bloody wounds, her breath a rasp. How many had she fought to get here? How many of them did it take to finally lay her low?</p><p>“I’m…sorry…”</p><p>Her mouth parts slightly as these words escape, and I drop to my knees and cradle her in my arms. She’s cold—<br>so<br> cold. How can someone be this cold when everything around us is nothing but fire and madness?</p><p>“I just wanted…to see my boy…”</p><p>Each of the sunflowers planted here represented a child that was stolen. So the Captain didn’t see them as flowers, but her son. That was why she came at the end of her life.</p><p>“I just wanted to see him…”</p><p>She repeats the phrase over and over, losing a little more of herself in the process.</p><p>“I just wanted to see him…</p><p>I just wanted to see him…</p><p>I just wanted to see him…”</p><p>But he’s here, Mom.</p><p>He’s right in front of you.</p><p>I wanted to tell her the truth, but I also knew it would make her last moments even more painful. After all, I was the same person who’d killed her husband not six months before. So instead, I hold her hand in mine and say nothing. Eventually it slips from my grasp and settles on the ground. A petal from one of the sunflowers drifts out of the fire and flutters toward us, and by the time it joins her hand on the earth, she is gone.</p><p>“I’ll come see you someday.” I whisper. “I swear it.”<br>But as sparks crackle off the sunflowers and drift away into the gloomy night, it feels like the dawn has never been so far away.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Child of Revenge<br>[<br>]</p><p>Carrier: All right, time for handoff!</p><p>Substitute: Boy…revenge…</p><p>Carrier: I see.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="F66x"><a href="#F66x" class="headerlink" title="F66x"></a>F66x</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>I think back on the past. On memories of the boy who will never come home. And on the happy family in the photo. My<br> embraces me. His warmth is the only constant in my life, and as he holds me, my chilly heart slowly melts.<br> I think. </p><p>A deafening rumble suddenly reverberates throughout the base, along with a siren. The announcement that follows tells us what we never wanted to hear: Flowers have invaded the base itself for the very first time. Cradling the photo, my husband and I dash for the exit. It would be folly to fight the Flowers unarmed, so we decide to evacuate instead.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The base is already a stage of tragedy. Our fellow prisoners, unable to fight the sudden army of Flowers, have been decimated. Among the bodies, we hear a voice calling for help. But we know that stopping means death. So we run…and don’t look back. As we do, we offer a silent apology.</p><p>We run for our lives, but the Flowers are everywhere. Eventually, they corner us and launch their assault.<br> I think—but the expected pain never comes. Instead, my husband leaps in front of me and takes the attack in my place. Somehow, he is still alive—but he will not survive another strike. He screams at me to run, but instead, I grip the photo and step forward. </p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Just as the Flower’s next attack is about to land, armed prisoners appear with our commander and cut it down. The defense operation has been put in motion—and somehow, the two of us are still alive. My husband’s wounds look painful, but he just chuckles and says he’s proud to have such badges of honor. I’m relieved to see he’s in good enough shape to joke. The two of us retreat with the commander. My husband’s wounds are deep and he is taken to the infirmary for surgery. I pray fervently that he will make a full recovery. I hand the photo to my husband as a good-luck charm.<br> My husband clutches it to his chest as they wheel him away.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>My heart grows cold. How much time has passed since he went in? He’d been joking around, so surely he’s going to be okay.<br> I feel like the uncertainty will crush me under its weight.</p><p>Finally, my husband emerges from the infirmary. Seeing him safe, I let out a small gasp of relief. However, he has no memory of the recent past…and the photo has also disappeared. The memory loss is due to shock, and only temporary—but no one can explain where the photo went. My husband, as if sensing my unease, wraps me up in another tight embrace. As I feel his warmth, my concerns melt away once more.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>When she was yet human</p><p>“This is a tale of the recent past.”</p><p>“A tale of a time when she was still human.”</p><p>“A tale of how Flowers were born into the world…”</p><p>“You’re going to grow up big and strong.” A woman murmurs these words to the organic matter growing inside the incubator. She operates the console with a practiced hand. Holographic panels float in the air before her, displaying detailed information on the status of the matter in the incubator. The data is diverse, covering everything from humidity and temperature to the concentration of oxygen, elemental makeup of the soil, and even thermal conductivity. Each number is one piece of a delicate dance; if one fails, the others will follow. It is difficult work, but the woman feels pride at her success thus far. Once, thousands of years in the past, Earth contained what was known as “nature.” Uncountable plants and animals flourished in ecosystems across the mountains and oceans—and they did so alongside humans. But due to human expansion and ecological pollution—as well as disasters and climate change wrought by nature itself—the ecology was weakened, and life began to sputter out. Now, the nature that once sparked plants and animals across the entire planet has been entirely lost.</p><p>The woman works in a genetic research facility. It was built with the newest and best technology available, and serves as a gathering place and laboratory for the world’s most prominent scholars and researchers. The woman, a leader in the field of genetic engineering, now concentrates all her efforts on the process of regenerating extinct plants and animals.</p><p>“You seem extra happy today,” she says to her latest experiment.</p><p>“So why don’t we give this a go?”</p><p>She flips switches and presses buttons on the console. Moments later, there is a beep and liquid sprays into the incubator. That liquid is a custom-made growth accelerant that interacts directly with DNA. The moment it lands on the organic matter, a white flower springs out of the soil.</p><p>“Yes!” cries the woman.</p><p>She permits herself a single fist pump. In truth, she wants to leap up and go dancing through the lab, but the fact she is under constant surveillance takes much of the fun out of such spontaneous celebrations. Not to mention her embarrassing incident of long ago…</p><p>“Brought another one back, did you?”</p><p>The speaker is a large, muscular man in a lab coat. Though his physique is more appropriate for a soldier, he is actually a talented scientist in his own right.</p><p>“Honey!” says the woman.</p><p>“I thought you were sleeping. But yes, come here and take a look at this.”</p><p>She and the man have been married for five years. They met in this very facility.</p><p>“It’s pretty,” murmurs the man as he bends down to get a better look at the incubator.</p><p>“What’s it called?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But according to the literature, they say finding one will grant your greatest wish.”</p><p>Though the woman would be embarrassed to admit as much, this story is the reason she chose to bring the flower back. For she has a wish she desires above all else: A wish to see the world filled with green once more. As she stares at the flower growing in the rich soil, she whispers her wish, hoping that it might hear. This world knows nothing but heartache and loss, and she wants to give it something good. It’s the reason she studied genetic engineering in the first place. And though it has been a journey of fits and starts, her plans are finally bearing fruit.</p><p>Suddenly, her thoughts are interrupted by the strident howl of an alarm, followed by a red light in the incubator. The two look inside and see the flower rapidly shriveling.</p><p>“No,” says the woman.</p><p>“No! Why is this happening!?”</p><p>She frantically rechecks the information on the panels. The numbers that represent the flower’s nutrients are all swiftly decreasing.</p><p>“Hang on. I’m going to raise the values.”</p><p>She pumps additional nutrients into the incubator—twice the normal amount. Liquid gushes out, adjusting the concentration of oxygen and the nutrients within the soil. But the flower continues to fade, its petals falling noiselessly onto the dirt below. Her husband looks at some of the numbers and furrows his brow.</p><p>“Strange. This flower is using far more energy than normal.”</p><p>It’s a calm observation, one made from the experience of seeing countless flora wither away in his own experiments. But the woman is in no mood to hear it.</p><p>I can’t let it die,<br> she thinks.<br>Not now. If it dies, my wish dies with it.</p><p>She doubles down and focuses on the console. More liquid enters the incubator’s glowing red interior.</p><p>“Come on,” she says through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Come<br>on<br>.”</p><p>“I’m not giving up on you now!”</p><p>Finally, the dripping flower begins to grow again, its fallen petals regenerating before their eyes…. But it does not stop. A moment later, the Flower smashes out of the incubator, sending tendrils and roots coiling across the floor. It almost seems to be searching for something. And it shows no signs of stopping.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A siren begins to wail. The couple presses against a far wall, trying to escape the thing they have unleashed. The Flower continues to grow. Soon, the roots have covered the entire floor.</p><p>The walls are gone. The celling is gone. Nearly the entire room is buried in plant matter. Suddenly, several of their fellow researchers force the door open and run into the lab.</p><p>“You guys all right?” one of them asks, breathless.</p><p>“We’re fine,” says the husband.</p><p>“Just used a heavy hand with the growth accelerant, is all.”</p><p>The husband explains the situation because his wife is sitting on the floor, too stunned to speak.</p><p>Their fellow scientists express relief to know the couple is safe.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” whispers the woman.</p><p>“God, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Her husband helps her to her feet and embraces her.</p><p>“It’s all right. I’m just glad you weren’t hurt.”</p><p>His warmth melts away the tension in her heart.</p><p>“Hey, did you guys see this? It’s really interesting…” One of their coworkers is tapping the side of the Flower’s stem. Others soon gather around to make their own observations, intrigued by the situation. The stem is far tougher than that of the original plant. And its mass has clearly increased. But it didn’t do so through multiplying cells—rather, it has simply increased in size.</p><p>“Hang on. What’s this?”</p><p>One scientist is staring at the petals.</p><p>“Guys, look. I think there’s something in here.”</p><p>“Wait, it could be dangerous,” says the woman.</p><p>“No, it’s okay. I’m just going to…”</p><p>“W-wait… My arm! It’s got my arm!”</p><p>The man’s voice begins to grow panicked. He’s clearly not joking. Suddenly, he lets out a horrifying wail. The other researchers attempt to pry the petals open, but they are hard as stone and won’t so much as budge.</p><p>“Help me!” screams the man.</p><p>“Oh god, SOMEONE HELP ME!”</p><p>The Flower begins to pull the man inside. His coworkers desperately try to free him, but they might as well be pulling a mountain.</p><p>“H-help… Heeelp meeeeee…”</p><p>The man is gone. From inside the now swollen corolla comes the sounds of something straining and cracking. Then it flies open and sprays blood across the entire room. A hunk of flesh—the remains of their coworker—flies out and tumbles across the floor. As they watch, horrified, a new Flower springs up from the meat. The germinated Flower grows just as rapidly as its kin, causing the meat to shrink at the same time.</p><p>“My god…” says the woman.</p><p>“It’s absorbing the nutrients.”</p><p>With the meat depleted, the Flower begins to squirm and writhe across the floor in search of a new source of food.</p><p>“Run!” someone yells.</p><p>“Get the hell out of here!”</p><p>The researchers dash away as one.</p><p>The screams continue. The Flowers pursue the survivors, slithering over the floor like snakes with petals for heads. Each time one of the petals consumes a victim, a new Flower sprouts from the remains. Their numbers grow. And grow. And<br>grow<br>.</p><p>“Here! Hide in here!”</p><p>The husband pulls the woman into a small closet in the corner of the research division.</p><p>They force their ragged breaths to slow as they try to remain quiet. Outside, the sounds of slithering and screams are everywhere.</p><p>“What have I done?”</p><p>This was my experiment. My flower. And now it’s eating people.</p><p>Was it a dangerous plant that should never have been revived?</p><p>Was it the fault of the growth accelerant I formulated?</p><p>Before she can wonder more, her husband pulls her close.</p><p>“Right now, we just need to survive.”</p><p>His embrace drives the fear and doubt from her mind. Her shivering slowly comes to a stop.</p><p>But the sounds outside continue without pause, and they know they do not have long. Suddenly, her husband lets her go and reaches for the door.</p><p>“Hang on, honey. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Before she can say anything, he bolts from the closet, seals the door behind him, and runs down the hall while making as much noise as he possibly can. It’s clear he’s trying to lure them away.<br>No, please… Please don’t leave me here alone…</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Time passes—she has no idea how much. Eventually, the slithers and screams die off, leaving the facility enrobed in an unnatural silence. She attempts to leave the closet, but the door is locked. The woman feels her body growing cold, perhaps due to fear and guilt. All she can do is wait and pray for her husband to return. Ironically, they had met in this very closet.</p><p>Her arms had been piled with equipment that day, and she was unable to work the knob. Suddenly, her gallant knight swooped in and opened the door for her.</p><p>“Maybe leave a few things behind next time, ya dope,” he’d said with a chuckle. Oh, she had been mad. More than mad—<br>furious<br>. But as he continued to assist her from time to time, she found herself becoming attracted to him. She had a tendency to get lost in her research, sometimes even forgetting to sleep and eat, but he was always there to support her.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice snaps her back to reality.</p><p>“…There? Is anyone there?” The woman leaps to her feet and starts pounding on the door.</p><p>“Here!” she cries. “I’m in here!” Footsteps pound into place outside the closet. She hears radio calls, breathing, muttered commands.</p><p>“We’re going to cut through the door. Stand back.”</p><p>A glowing red dot appears in the center of the door, sending up smoke. Soon, the high-temperature cutter begins slicing a hole in the steel. When it is halfway done, she peeks through the opening and beholds a horrible sight. The walls, floors, and ceiling of the facility have had furrows gouged into them by the snaking movements of the Flowers. And within each furrow is tightly packed meat that oozes fresh blood. Bodies that weren’t absorbed had been ground into paste by the sheer bulk of the Flowers. The woman can’t even tell who they used to be. But when the smell hits her, she turns aside and vomits.</p><p>“You all right, ma’am?”</p><p>The voice comes from a soldier looking at her through the hole in the door. He’s covered head-to-toe in thick black armor and holds an imposing beam rifle in his hand. He looks to be ready for war. The woman nods, wipes her mouth with a shaking hand, and crawls out through the hole.</p><p>The smell is worse out here.<br>Much<br> worse. And it brings everything rushing back: The screams of pain. The snapping of bones. The delight of the Flowers as they ate. She can hear and see it all over again. She turns to the side and vomits once more, but all that comes out is a stream of yellow bile. Her body has nothing left to give.</p><p>“W-were there any others survivors?” asks the woman, hoping against hope for a miracle. The soldiers just shake their heads. The hues of despair grow darker. But she cannot stay here. Not when he might be alive. Not when he might need her help.</p><p>“I’m coming with you,” she says. “I need to find my husband.”</p><p>“Oh, and I know every inch of this facility, so I can guide you wherever you need to go.”</p><p>After a brief conference, the solders bring her along. Eventually, they arrive at the most heavily damaged area. This is Research Block 21—the location of the woman’s lab. It’s as if someone redecorated the room to look like a version of Hell. Everything, from the floors to the ceiling, is painted red: Blood from the birth of a Flower. How many of her coworkers had been consumed? How many had she<br>killed<br>? The guilt chills her to the bone.</p><p>Suddenly, a deep bellow rumbles out. Something is coming their way. Something massive.</p><p>“In positions, now!”</p><p>The soldiers raise rifles to shoulders as the enemy approaches. It’s a Flower—one far bigger than any they’ve seen before. It is the most horrible sight imaginable. The petals are imprinted with the faces of victims. Not one face or two—but<br>dozens<br>. But the military captain pays this no mind.</p><p>“All units…fire.” The world dissolves into a hail of gunfire. The Flower begins to scream.</p><p>My god… It sounds human. Could it really have evolved human traits so quickly?<br> Above the crackle and roar of the firefight, the woman hears a most familiar voice. And when she looks at the Flower again, she sees the face of her love.</p><p>“Stop! Don’t shoot him!”</p><p>She rushes for a nearby soldier, but he pays her no mind. Her pleas go unheard. Her actions are meaningless. Her husband is gone. Knowing this, she breaks down into sobs.<br>This is my fault. It’s all my fault.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>When the fighting stops, the Flower lies unmoving on the ground. The woman cradles her dead husband and continues to apologize. She does so until her voice finally fails her.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Months go by. They thought they’d dispatched the Flowers that day…. But they were wrong. Another Flower had been found. Then another. And another. The Flowers sow seeds soon after they are born. It is all anyone can talk about anymore. The news is nothing but death figures and horrible stories. And those who manage to escape often find they have no home to return to. The Flowers evolve. They adapt. They increase their reproductive rates, perfect their strategy, and soon are the greatest disaster the world has ever known.</p><p>“…No. No! NO!”</p><p>Enraged, the woman smashes her hand against the console. Her cheeks are hollow; her eyes darkened pits. She can’t remember the last time she slept. Currently, she is working in a small laboratory constructed by another organization. Their only goal is to find a way to stop the Flowers. As the sole survivor from the research facility, leadership of this fight had fallen on her shoulders. She was locked away and tasked with analyzing Flower carcasses in order to find a chemical solution that could kill them. For a time, it looked like their quest would be successful—but the Flowers quickly evolved a resistance to the solution. Each time they created a new chemical, the Flowers adapted to counter it.</p><p>Now, she stands before a Flower in a massive incubator. On its petals she sees the faces of her coworkers and husband. Her mind has whirled with thoughts since that day. Were they things she should not wish for? Did they go against nature? Was all of this technology too powerful for humans? She has thought about putting herself out of her misery. But when she thinks of what her husband went through, she finds herself driven by the need for redemption. But this, too, is coming to an end. It has been five days since her liaison with the outside world stopped arriving. Perhaps he decided the research was fruitless and walked away. Perhaps a Flower killed him. Her food supplies are gone, yet she feel strangely at ease. She wonders idly if her senses are beginning to break down. From a distance, she hears the approaching footsteps of the reaper.</p><p>“Honey…”</p><p>Her husband floats in the incubator, fully merged with the Flower. If she was just doing this to die a failure in the end, it would have been better to become part of the petals with him.</p><p>But I know you wouldn’t give up.<br> She stands up once more, fighting off the despair in her heart.</p><p>And then…an idea. She fiddles with the console, a faint smile on her face. Perhaps it is folly—or perhaps it is the only way they will ever be able to kill the Flowers.</p><p>Days pass. The liaison never arrives. The woman is skin and bones, barely able to move. She stands before the incubator with an inscrutable expression and stares at the thing inside. There, floating in the tank, is a couple. She had combined the genes of people and Flowers to create clones of herself and her husband. With a shaking hand, she operates the console. The liquid in the incubator drains away, and the couple awakens.</p><p>“Your name is F66x.”</p><p>“Your name is 063y.”</p><p>“Together, you will eliminate the Flowers from this world.”</p><p>The couple nods silently. No matter how many times they might be stricken with despair… No matter how many times they meet a cruel end… They will be reborn again, and throw themselves into battle with the hated Flowers anew. That is how they will achieve victory—and how the woman will gain her redemption. And so, she gives her cloned self its first order: “Kill me.”</p><p>The clone nods silently and wraps its hands around her neck. As fingers tighten, consciousness slips away. Yet the woman wears an expression of utter peace.</p><p>Decades pass. The Flowers can infinitely reproduce. The clones can infinitely reproduce. Their war rages on to this day. And in the midst of this neverending battle, nature begins to take root within the empty cities.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Change (My) Life<br>[<br>]</p><p>The only sounds in the empty room are a metronomic beeping and the quiet breathing of my husband. He is bound to the bed, his entire body wired to a machine that controls his body temperature, heart rate, and all other life functions. Next to him, a young officer speaks softly to me.</p><p>“He acquired confidential information again, Commander. This is his eight instance of unauthorized access to such intelligence.”</p><p>As she speaks, details of my husband’s previous infractions appear on a nearby wall screen. I’m not surprised; it’s always been like this. Whenever he sees a chance, he breaks into some area deep within the base and steals classified data about the Flowers.</p><p>“I’m sorry Commander, but I can’t cover for him anymore.”</p><p>Commander.<br> The word stings my ears. I hate being called by that title around my husband, even though he’s not awake to hear it.</p><p>It wasn’t always like this. But one day, the Flowers attacked our world and everything changed. Humanity is yet to find a key to victory; if anything, we fade a little more each time the sun rises on a new day. We’ve lost so many now: soldiers, prisoners, and yes, even commanders. The Flowers have taken them all. But the lack of people in leadership positions is our most pressing concern, so the people in charge attempted to solve it with a most novel solution:</p><p>They promoted the prisoners.</p><p>Prisoners like me.</p><p>The job of commander is to manage and control the rest of the prisoners. So when news of my own promotion came, I knew instantly that I would have to send my own husband off into the jaws of death. I couldn’t bear to share that with him, so I attempted to keep it a secret and live my life just as I always had—until the day he broke into the base and first stole confidential information.</p><p>We have rules for people who do such things. The punishment is very swift—and very final. But instead of putting him to death, I used privileges of command to keep him alive. I ordered the classified information deleted from his memories, and we returned to our normal lives. I thought I could somehow keep this up—that I could keep lying to everyone about what I was now. And I might have done it, except that my husband stole classified information again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And<br>again.</p><p>The irony is almost too much to bear: The reason he risked death to find some path to victory against the Flowers was because he wanted to protect<br>me.<br> But now, once again, it is my turn to protect him.</p><p>“Prepare for memory deletion.” I say to the officer. When she doesn’t move, I slowly turn my head to look at her. “That is a direct order.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, ma’am, but I cannot comply.”</p><p>Her quiet voice rattles in my ears. “What did you say?”</p><p>“Your husband should have been eliminated after his first transgression, but you used your authority to delete his memories and protect him. I’ve stood by as you did so again and again, but I can abide it no longer.”</p><p>She goes on to tell me that my actions are not as secret as I thought—other commanders are aware of what I have been doing, and they are displeased to say the least. If it does not stop, they will deem me unfit for command and dispose of me in the way all useless prisoners are dealt with.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for this,” I whisper. “I didn’t ask for any of it.”</p><p>And it’s true. I didn’t. I didn’t care for the power of command, or the honor, or the ceremonial trappings. The only thing I cared about was protecting the man I love.</p><p>“You have to stop this,” says the officer. “We have plans in motions, great plans that may finally turn the tide of this war and give you the revenge you seek. Would you really throw all of that away?”</p><p>She takes my hand and places it gently atop the machine. “If you turn this off, his vitals will cease to function. He’ll just… go to sleep. Quickly. Peacefully. But we’re running out of time, Commander, and we need you to make a decision.”</p><p>Her quiet voice is a faint echo in the empty room.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Change (Your) Love<br>[<br>]</p><p>The leisurely beeping that disturbs the quiet of the living room tells me the water is boiling. I get up from my chair and head to the kitchen, where I take out an assortment of snacks and prepare my tea.</p><p>Treatment like this was nigh unthinkable when I was a low-ranking soldier—or to be more blunt, a prisoner with a slightly more palatable title. But now I own a first-class apartment with a guest room—don’t know when I’ll be using that—and a constant supply of luxuries like sweets and tea.</p><p>Yes, my life certainly became enriched when I took on the position of a superior officer. But every day I wake up and ask myself what the point is to having such wealth. What even is the point?</p><p>I glanced over at the framed photograph in the center of the living room, the one showing a smiling image of my husband. He was my rock. My light. The person I loved more than anything.</p><p>And the person I killed.</p><p>Pressured by command, I made the decision to turn off my husband’s life support, abandoning what was most precious to me for the benefit of the base. As a result, my subordinates found renewed confidence in me, and my superiors praised my loyalty. But this brings me right back around to the same question I always ask: What’s the point? What is the goddamn point?</p><p>I briefly considered following my husband into the afterlife, but couldn’t do it. The shrewd watch of my commanders played a part in that decision, but ultimately, I couldn’t abandon my plan to end the Flowers once and for all.</p><p>Blowing steam across my mug, I press a few buttons on a small screen on the kitchen counter and pull up footage from a surveillance camera. Children’s voices come through, as well as the shrill bark of an overseer.</p><p>“Get in line, all of you!”</p><p>“Kay!”</p><p>There are countless prisoners exhausted by this never-ending war with the Flowers—and our recent rise in deserters is proof. But I’ve come up with a plan to give even the lowest soldier a reason to fight. Want to hear it? It’s a doozy.</p><p>See, I proposed we implant prisoners with memories of having children, then supply them with<br>actual<br> children to protect. I figured I’d face an uphill battle—or be laughed out of the room entirely—but to my shock, command not only approved the plan, they supplied the children that I needed to make it work. The little moppets now live in a care center in the base, giving the prisoners who are their “parents” a reason to keep fighting in the outside world.</p><p>The irony just<br>kills<br> me.</p><p>My own son was killed by the Flowers, is the thing—and the animosity born from that memory is what kept me alive all this time. The pain of the loss is a set of teeth on my heart as fresh as the day it happened, so the fact I’m using that same pain to help my former companions rush headlong into death is…</p><p>Well it’s monstrous.</p><p>Monstrous.</p><p>But now that I’ve chosen this path, there’s no turning back. I have to destroy the Flowers and have my revenge, because—</p><p>“I’m hooome! What’s my snack?”</p><p>A small figure rushes into the living room, and I shake myself free from my reverie as I turn to him. “You have something to do before snack time, yes?”</p><p>His face lights up as he rushes to the most prominent place in the living room: the memorial for my husband. The boy takes the photograph and holds it reverently in both of his tiny hands.</p><p>“I’m home, Dad!”</p><p>God, his eyes remind me<br>so<br> much of him…</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Change (His) Life<br>[<br>]</p><p>In my position as a senior officer, I’ve led countless projects to completion—not just the one that keeps soldiers from deserting. We’ve also mapped Flower dens around the planet, performed research into their ecology, and developed a host of new weapons. Though we’ve yet to exterminate the enemy, humanity has stepped back from the brink, and is now in the process of putting itself together again.</p><p>“Sorry we took so long, Mom.”</p><p>I turn to find my son walking into the officer’s lounge. He’s grown over the years, and is now more a man than the little boy I remembered.</p><p>“Thank you for taking the time to be here,” I say.</p><p>A woman steps out from behind my son, her wide eyes boring deep into my own.</p><p>“Uh, so, Mom? This is my girlfriend. I think I…mentioned her?”</p><p>His bashful introduction causes me to chuckle.</p><p>“Hello, ma’am,” she says. “My name is ———, and I work in the research division.”</p><p>The introduction is sweet, but unnecessary; I already know everything there is to know about her. Her name, age, job, time of birth—every moment of her life is at my fingertips. Yet I manage to put on an expression of ignorance and listen to the rest of her introduction.</p><p>“I’m pleased to have met you today,” I say when she’s done. Our chat is short, but pleasant enough, and I’m happy to see how tactfully she handles her time in the spotlight. But then, at the moment when my son is<br>supposed<br> to ease us out of the awkward silence that follows introductions, he blurts out:</p><p>“You two are kind of similar.”</p><p>“Similar?” asks his girlfriend. “You mean me and your mother?”</p><p>“Yeah. Like, I dunno. The vibes you give off.”</p><p>My mouth twists wryly at that. “Saying your girlfriend reminds you of your mother is the worst possible thing you could say, Son. If she never speaks to you again, I’ll fully support her decision.”</p><p>An awkward expression crosses my son’s face, which causes his girlfriend to burst out laughing. The tension eased at last, they give brief farewells and leave the lounge. As I watch them go, a small sigh rises in my heart. A moment later, my commander arrives and places a hot drink before me.</p><p>“Thank you,” I murmur quietly. The tea is just warm enough not to burn. She knows exactly what I like—no surprise, seeing as we’ve been mostly inseparable ever since I rose up to the position of senior officer. Perhaps that’s why she feels comfortable enough to look me in the eye and say:</p><p>“How does it feel to have your husband introduce his girlfriend to you?”</p><p>Ah, she’s always like this. She seems cold and emotionless most of the time, but in truth, she finds nothing more delightful than pushing people’s buttons.</p><p>“He is my<br>son<br> now.”</p><p>Here’s the thing: Once I learned that management possessed the technology to create clones, I used my husband’s stored genetic data to make one, then took him out of the incubator while he was still a baby. This was only done to protect him; if he were to mature there and have my husband’s old memories implanted, he’d only make the same mistake of accessing top-secret data all over again.</p><p>“And what about<br>her<br>? Does she meet expectations?”</p><p>“Not in the slightest.”</p><p>“Why not? She has a stellar reputation, and seems extremely well-tempered.”</p><p>“It’s not a question of character. Her performance is simply too average.”</p><p>This is true. The girl has shown no aptitude for science, and seems content to remain a lowly, anonymous researcher. She’s nothing like me, which means she is no proper match for<br>him<br>.</p><p>I lean back and close my eyes. Bringing up an image of her smiling face, I mentally scrawl a red X across it.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Changeling<br>[<br>]</p><p>Something rocks me, stirring me from sleep. When I open my eyes, I’m greeted by a bright, false sun and the familiar sight of my commander’s face.</p><p>“He’s crying. Should you attend to him?”</p><p>She jerks her chin toward a small crib, where I hear a baby’s disgruntled mumbling.</p><p>“Oh, yes. Thank you. Goodness, my hearing has gotten worse as I’ve grown older; I used to leap out of bed at the slightest sound when my son was a baby!”</p><p>I lift the baby into my arms and look into his eyes. “You were sleeping so soundly, little one. What do you need? A diaper change? Milk?”</p><p>As I rock the little guy in my arms to calm him down, a smile cracks across my commander’s face. It isn’t a warm, fond smile, but a cold and pitying one.</p><p>“He looks so much like you.”</p><p>“You think so?” I reply quietly, pretending not to hear the thorns in her speech.</p><p>“But I suppose he would. The father is your husb…Apologies. Your<br>son<br>. And the mother is your clone too.”</p><p>She’s correct. Around the time I created my husband’s clone, I made a dozen clones of myself. I altered some so they didn’t look exactly like me, then removed them from the incubators and gave them to prisoners who could serve as suitable parents.</p><p>“I’m surprised it went so well. Was every girl your son dated your clone?”</p><p>All my clones had been raised in varying environments, which means they show their uniqueness in different ways. Some are excellent workers with brilliant talent. Some are average. Some dropouts.</p><p>“His mother is quiet and seems average at a glance, but she has an analytical mind.”</p><p>Those who are quiet and tend to have subdued emotions are often more colorful with those they’re comfortable with.</p><p>“She’s family-oriented,” my commander says, her tone as flat as if she’s reading from a document. “Your son’s wife is almost exactly like you, from her skill set to her personality—and to a rather shocking degree.”</p><p>I’d spent decades carefully putting this project into motion just for this moment. I sent my clones to my son so they would meet, made sure they dated, then encouraged them to have children.</p><p>“Do you think me odd?”</p><p>I ask suddenly.</p><p>My commander nods. “I do. However, I don’t think it’s a bad thing. This is the happiest I’ve ever seen you.”</p><p>My son has been taken from me. My husband is lost. But now, at long last, I finally have it all back. This child was born from a clone of my husband and my own clone. it is my—<br>our<br>—true son.</p><p>I look down and realize the grumpy, crying baby has finally begun to snore softly in my arms.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Chatty Woman<br>[<br>]</p><p>Ugh, I hate getting assigned to expeditions.

But does she need to be<br> angry? She’s not being reasonable—and I’m going to tell her so!</p><p>Uh oh. The moment I open my mouth, she launches into a rant about all of her woes: I don’t understand women. I’m crude. I’m insensitive. She starts unloading all sorts of stuff on me. Blah, blah, blah. Well, I’m sure as hell not going to just lie back and take all that!</p><p>“You know, this is what I hate about you!” I snarl.</p><p>“You’re always bringing up these stupid unrelated issues!”</p><p>The moment the words leave my mouth, I know I’ve gone too far: one look at her face is all I need to realize that. She points to the door—and I know what<br> means. And while part of me is annoyed as hell at all of this… I decide to get out while the getting’s good.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I escape to the mess hall. My friends come up to me and ask what’s the matter—guess I look a little pale. But when I tell them how I just had a blow-up with the wife, their concern dissolves into peals of laughter. After they have their fun, they tell me I’m the one at fault. Each one has a different strategy I can use to make amends. As they talk, I realize they’re pretty good pals, all in all.</p><p>I decide to put their plan into motion. I return to the room and pick my wife up off her feet. She seems perplexed, but intrigued—which is good. I then start spinning her around the room in a dance, showing off my strength as well as my moves. But of course, I take it too far. By the time I realize it, her face has progressed from confusion to downright fury. So before I can wreck it more, I dash out of the room.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>As I think about what to do, the unit commander appears. Word of our martial squabble has spread throughout the base. He warns me it will be a hindrance to our operations. Since he seems to care, I tell him what happened and ask for his advice. He chuckles a little. He then tells me he doesn’t have an ideas—and doesn’t care enough to think of any. But then he gives me a piece of “paper”—something people apparently used long, long ago in order to make amends. I don’t know what’s he’s thinking, but he’s not the kind of man to act without purpose. I decide his words must have<br> meaning. Apparently “paper” is a relic of the past used for writing. That’s when it comes to me:</p><p>Since I usually say too much. I’ll write a “letter” to my wife instead.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>But I’m not sure what usually goes into a letter. Maybe I should start with thanks for everything she does for me every day? No, wait. An apology is probably better. I write letter after letter as I think of my wife. I write, then erase. Write, then erase.</p><p>Write, then erase. After ten or so attempts, the letter is finally complete. I go home and hand it to my wife, whose eyes go wide. This could just be because a letter is so unfamiliar, but more likely it’s because I’m genuinely apologizing. Once she reads the letter, she smiles and looks at me. Then she wraps me up in a hug… It would seem all is forgiven. My messy writing on the crumpled paper was simple: “I will protect and love you with all of my life. This I swear…” No matter what the future may hold.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Test Record #1104</p><p>“Morning, sleepyhead. You getting up today?”</p><p>The man gently places his hand on his<br>wife’s<br> cheek as he speaks; her skin is cool to the touch.</p><p>Her temperature must drop while she sleeps<br>, he thinks. The woman does not so much as stir.</p><p>The only sound in the room is her deep, steady breathing. It is the only way he knows she still lives.</p><p>She has been asleep for nearly two weeks.</p><p>Ten days ago, they fought Flowers in the city ruins. It was a relentless battle, and many did not see it through to come out intact on the other side. His wife’s head was injured during the skirmish, and though the wound is healing nicely, she remains unconscious. The doctor said it was an after-effect of receiving a strong blow to the brain. He also warned the man she might never regain herself. He knows he should be happy she still lives. Nonetheless, he finds himself praying:</p><p>“Please wake up, honey.<br>Please.<br>“</p><p>The man had already lost his son to the Flowers. And now they threatened to steal his wife as well.</p><p>His body shivers in fear at the prospect, the anxiety boring a hole in his heart. The Flowers were taking everything from him.<br>Everything.<br> Hate swirls inside him as he unconsciously clenches his hands into fists. If only he could eradicate the Flowers…</p><p>If only he had the strength to kill them…</p><p>All right, enough of that. She’s going to wake up<br>. The man draws himself up straight, patching the hole in his heart through sheer force of will. Soon, a voice comes over the PA announcing mealtime. Even this dreary announcement, played at the same time every day, serves to take his mind from his troubles. For the first time ever, he finds the managed routines and strict rules of his lifestyle are granting him a sense of security and peace.</p><p>“I’m off to eat, honey,” he whispers.</p><p>“Be back soon.”</p><p>The man makes his way to the feeding hall. It is a simple space fitted with sterile terminals where people receive meals after scanning their IDs, as well as rows of small tables where they can eat. Right now, it is filled with prisoners who live in the man’s block. They line up in neat rows, receive the same food, plop down in assigned seats, and eat silently. The prisoners are treated like animals; it is an unnerving sight. But tools for war must be properly managed. The man looks at the empty seat beside him where his wife would typically sit. The food seems even more bland than usual this day.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of their commander rings out.</p><p>“Eyes on, people!” Tension ripples through the prisoners; an appearance from the commander typically foreshadows a problem.</p><p>“We are currently recruiting testers for new equipment. Anyone who wishes to take part can apply at the terminal in their room. That is all.”</p><p>The message delivered, he spins on a heel and leaves. The prisoners breathe a sigh of relief. The R&amp;D Department was constantly researching weapons and other gear that might be of use against the Flowers. They managed every aspect of the prisoners’ equipment, right down to what they wore in their daily lives. Their clothes heightened the wearer’s resistances and strength, but also allowed the commander control of their bodies and minds. Despite their ill feelings toward their garb, they all agreed the clothes had saved their lives on multiple occasions. For the man, however, the fact he is no better than a slave is something he has made peace with—for he will shoulder any burden and bear any pain to have his revenge. He will do whatever is necessary.</p><p>New equipment, eh? Interesting…</p><p>With more powerful weapons and equipment, they could inflict more damage on the Flowers and return from battle with fewer casualties. And maybe even end the war altogether. The man knows many people will apply to test the new equipment, because they all share this same goal. Plus, better equipment means a better chance of survival. The man thinks it over. Though he wishes to stay at his wife’s side, he knows he won’t actually be able to<br>do<br> anything for her. So when he returns to his room, he turns on his terminal and applies to test the new equipment.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several days later, the man finds himself walking toward the R&amp;D training room. When he arrives, five prisoners are already there. These are the applicants who were chosen. There does not seem to be a particular type: he sees all kinds, from muscle-bound men to slender, wiry women. Once they are gathered, the commander begins to speak:</p><p>“Put your gear on and prepare to spar.”</p><p>The commander brings out six sets of bizarre clothing. They are called enhancement suits, and each one upgrades its wearer in different ways.</p><p>The man’s suit is called a “power model.”</p><p>It is designed to heighten the wearer’s physical strength. The outfit is completely black, and has a solemn, imposing air. It is made from a thick, heavy material that seems designed to function as a flexible suit of armor. He puts it on and closes the seals, noting with grim satisfaction how it encloses his entire body. The remaining five suits for the other prisoners consist of three combat-oriented models—speed, defense, and magic—and two support models: scout and medic. Today, they will be testing the combat suits.</p><p>His suit ready, the man walks to the middle of the room. Opposite him is a man in a speed suit. He can’t be more than twenty years old—little more than a kid. His suit is bright yellow, and appears only lightly armored.<br>Speed, eh? I wonder how fast we’re talkin’ here.<br> The two combatants face each other, muscles tense. After a few moments, a buzzer sounds.</p><p>“I’m coming for you, old man!” screams the kid.</p><p>The moment the words leave his mouth, he closes the distance between them in a blur. Before the man even knows what is happening, the kid punches him square in the face. He stumbles across the room before coming to a stop against the back wall.</p><p>“Oh, it ain’t naptime yet, pops!”</p><p>The kid races across the room before the man can even regain his feet. He begins dancing around him, always in his blind spot, pummeling him with a series of rapid blows and kicks. But the man feels no pain. The impact is intense, but lacks the power to penetrate his armor. The kid quickly seems to grasp this as well, and redoubles his attacks in an effort to pummel his foe into some kind of submission. His arms move too fast to be seen. His legs are streaks of yellow light.</p><p>“Give up already, you dog!” the kid taunts. With each strike the kid makes, he tosses in a barb of the tongue. The man can’t tell if his opponent is trying to goad him into sloppiness or is just always like this. Regardless, the kid clearly has the mindset of a warrior. The man places his back against the wall and raises his guard. Though each strike by itself does little damage, he knows the kid’s furious onslaught will eventually wear him down. The man looks for chances to strike back, but the kid’s speed shows no sign of slowing. Perhaps the speed suit also raises his stamina. Regardless, the power model is heavy, and unsuited to prolonged fights.<br>Time for a new plan…</p><p>“Was that you hitting me just now, kid? I thought a fly landed on me.”</p><p>“The hell did you say!?”</p><p>Taking the bait, the young man launches a roundhouse kick. His foot makes contact with the man’s side, sending a shockwave through his entire body…. But it also leaves an opening. Before the kid can recover, the man rears back and drives a fist into his gut. The young man stops moving. He stands in place, wobbling back and forth like a dying top, then slumps to the ground.</p><p>“N-nice shot, buddy…” says the kid as he fades into unconsciousness.</p><p>“But next time, I…won’t lose…”</p><p>“Heh. You fought well, kid.”</p><p>The man chuckles at his opponent’s unceasing confidence, even when staring down defeat.</p><p>His clouded heart feels a bit lighter.</p><p>The prisoners—including the kid—spend the next few days in their suits, pushing them to their very limits. Once this is done, they are ready to test them for true.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Urban Residential District: Block One The prisoners stand in a line amidst abandoned buildings. Each one is clad in a different suit. Their mission is to eliminate all Flowers in the area. Though technically a capability test of the suits, it is still a genuine battle. If the test goes well, the enhancement suits would be officially rolled out as new equipment, and hopefully increase the survival rates of all prisoners. The six are determined to make the mission a success. The scout activates her sensors and scans the area. Ten Flowers are detected in Block Three. Flowers typically live in easily spotted clusters. However, there are also stealth types that do not show up on scans. They will have to keep their guards up at all times. The six slowly and carefully pick their way through the ruins.</p><p>Urban Residential District: Block Three The party receives visual confirmation of ten Flowers straight ahead. They are relieved to hear the scout’s information was accurate, and proceed to the next phase of the plan. The magic unit initiates the attack. She fires a heat ray from a massive gun, transforming a nearby Flower to ash. This model of suit is vulnerable while firing, but a surprise attack solves that problem.</p><p>“Go, kid!” yells the man.</p><p>“Do your thing!”</p><p>The kid leaps into a cluster of Flowers and begins raining blows down upon them. The man follows close behind, swinging a massive greatsword that mows down everything in its path.</p><p>The battle is over in an instant. The power of the suits is overwhelming. They will turn the tide of the war. But this overwhelming victory—and the hope it brings—makes them sloppy, and they drop their guard.</p><p>“Look out!” cries the scout.</p><p>“Something’s co—“</p><p>A Flower emerges from the ground under the scout’s feet. She is thrown to the side, where she lands with her neck at an impossible angle. Death is instantaneous.</p><p>“Everyone, behind me!” yells the defense unit.</p><p>He raises a shield as the others form up in his wake. More Flowers rip through the ground beneath them. The magic unit is torn in two, causing chunks of flesh and bone to rain down around them.<br>Don’t lose heart now<br>, thinks the man as he grips his sword. Over a dozen Flowers now loom around them—and a moment later, they unleash hell. The defense unit adjusts his position to take the brunt of the attack, while the medic does her best to keep him upright. Meanwhile, the speed and power units make their way through the chaos, cutting down one Flower before moving on to the next. It is a solid battle plan—at least at first. But while the medic can heal wounds, she is powerless against the pain that accompanies a broken bone or a dislocated joint. Slowly but surely, pain begins to overwhelm the defense unit. Finally, it becomes too much to bear. He turns to flee the battlefield, and is immediately set upon and torn apart by a pair of Flowers. Six of the creatures now remain, and the man in his power suit steps into place at the fore. Each time a Flower strikes at him, he responds with a vicious attack of his own.</p><p>I won’t die here. Not now. Not like this.</p><p>I won’t leave my wife all alone!</p><p>This thought is enough to carry him through the fight. The man hears a terrible sound—a cry of fear and pain and utter, complete rage. He does not even realize he is the one making it.</p><p>Time passes. Time stands still. Eventually the man emerges from his bloodlust and sees the kid resting on his knees.</p><p>“W-we did it…” whispers the kid.</p><p>“We actually did it.”</p><p>Only then does the man notice the shredded remains of Flowers all around them. There might still be more lurking underground. If so, he does not have the energy to fight. Suddenly, he hears a familiar announcement:</p><p>“Enhancement suit battle test complete.”</p><p>“Commencing phase three of the experiment.”</p><p>As though triggered by the voice, pain courses through his head. Suddenly, a voice rings out, blocking all other thought.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>KILL THE ENEMY.</p><p>At the last line, the man loses consciousness.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>When the man’s eyes next flutter open, he finds himself lying on the floor. He struggles to his feet as the fog begins to lift from his mind… And he beholds a grisly sight. The floor is a lake of blood. In the center, hunks of flesh and a broken staff.<br>That staff… It’s the medic’s.<br> The man examines the chunks and finally finds what remains of the medic’s face. Her suit has been forcefully pried open and her skin peeled from her very bones. There’s not even enough left for a proper burial. The man feels nausea building inside him and turns away. But this only reveals a new horror: The kid—or what remains of him. He has been impaled on a massive greatsword. His arms have been plucked from the body and discarded; his face is little more than a ruined crater. It appears the corpse was pummeled into submission long past the point where the man who existed inside was dead.</p><p>No… No, this can’t be…</p><p>A horrible feeling crawls up his spine. Cold sweat runs down his face.</p><p>That sword… It’s mine.</p><p>“You killed him,” says a familiar voice.</p><p>The man whirls around to find the commander.</p><p>“I…killed him?”</p><p>His mind rejects this fact, as does his heart. But he cannot deny his bloody hands. Or his black suit—which is now a vivid red.</p><p>I did this… Oh god, I did this!</p><p>“Calm yourself. You are not to blame here.”</p><p>The commander proceeds to tell him everything.</p><p>It had all been an experiment. Command had set up the Flowers’ surprise attack—</p><p>and once it was over, they deprived the prisoners of consciousness and had them fight to the death. The commander had planned everything. After revealing this, he begins to regale the man with tales of all the data they gained from the experiment, his glee barely contained. But the man cannot hear him. His thoughts are a whirling vortex of rage.</p><p>“It appears to be somewhat dependent on the user’s mental state and personality,” continues the commander.</p><p>“But overall, the power suit was shown to provide the best balance of offense and defense.”</p><p>“We will begin mass-manufacturing it at once.”</p><p>The man’s rage compresses, finding a target in the commander.</p><p>“So my friends died for a goddamn<br>test<br>?” he growls.</p><p>“No progress is without sacrifice,” says the commander.</p><p>His tone is flat, as if the subject bores him. Enraged, the man rears back and launches a fist directly at the commander’s face. But his arm stops before it connects, his body refusing to allow it.</p><p>For all his power, he is still a prisoner.</p><p>“DAMN YOU TO HELL!” he wails.</p><p>The commander stares at the man impassively.</p><p>“I could dispose of you here and now, you know? It actually might be the smart thing to do, considering all that you’ve learned.”</p><p>An image of the man’s wife leaps into his mind.<br>I can’t die yet.<br> The man furrows his brow and slowly lowers his fist.</p><p>“Good. What happened here today will be our little secret.”</p><p>“We expect great things from your tenacity, prisoner.”</p><p>“No sacrifice is too great if it means victory over the Flowers.”</p><p>This said, the commander collects some bits of suits and departs. Silence fills the void.</p><p>I can’t die yet. I can’t die yet. I can’t die yet.</p><p>The man repeats these four words over and over.<br> I have to live for her. And the more of us who wear these suits, the more of us who will survive. He’s right. This is a<br> good<br>thing<br>. The man had killed them all—Flower and friend alike. Yet he felt a sense of might at his power. A sense of guilt for his actions. And a sense of excitement at the possibilities. All of these things eat away at him.<br>I am strong enough to protect. I am strong enough to kill.<br> The darkness inside him swells and writhes and expands until finally it consumes what remains of his heart.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Escape<br>[<br>]</p><p>The alarm shrieks throughout the base, disturbing the pristine silence of the night.</p><p>“ALERT. DESERTER DETECTED. CAPTURE ALIVE IF POSSIBLE.”</p><p>I hear the commander’s voice murmuring from the comms device I stole and know they’re talking about me. But just as I peek my head around the corner to see what’s what, a searchlight grazes my cheek.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>In front of me stand massive mechanical bodies twice the size of a human. Their eyes gleam ominously in the night as they sweep the area for prey. As I look, another appears. Then another. Then another. While they amass, I creep forward as slowly as possible so as not to catch their attention.</p><p>So how did all this happen? That’s easy: because of the Flowers. The appeared out of the blue one day and stole all of our happy lives away. My wife and I, we had a son, but… God, he was so young.</p><p>I volunteered to fight the Flowers in an attempt to find some kind of revenge, but humanity still hasn’t found the key to victory. My wife’s been in low spirits lately—she’s clearly exhausted by all the fighting—and I worry I may end up losing her at this rate. So that’s why I decided to conduct my own survey of the Flowers and find a way out of this no-win scenario.</p><p>As I delved into the depths of the base, I managed to download reams of data from a computer in a classified area. It was an incredibly risky move, but it ended up being more than worth it; hidden in all that data was the location of something called the Flower Den, which is the enemy’s main base. It was the kind of intel that could change everything.</p><p>But before I could even process what I’d found, I tripped an alarm and had to make a break for it. I spent so much time hiding in the shadows as I made my way inch by agonizing inch toward the exit. And now, an eternity later, I find myself so very close to my goal.</p><p>I reach up and touch my pocket to make sure the downloaded information is still there. The moment I do, a brilliant white light washes over me.</p><p>“DESERTER LOCATED.”</p><p>The voice is cold, and it grows louder as its mechanical owner moves toward my position. I can’t let them catch me here; if they do, all of this will have been for nothing.</p><p>“DROP YOUR WEAPON. LIE ON THE GROUND.”</p><p>Squinting under the light, I put my fingers on the grip of my greatsword. “All right, big fella, no need to get your panties in a twist. I’m not going to fight back.”</p><p>I toss my weapon, which clatters to the floor. “There. I’m unarmed. We good here?”</p><p>“APPREHENDING TARGET.”</p><p>The machine moves forward, ready to subdue me, but I have a surprise in store. Before it can grab me, I slip through its legs and heave myself up and onto its back, then yank the cover off the base of its neck and jam my device into the waiting socket.</p><p>“MALWARE DETECTED. COMMENCING FORCED SHUTDOWN.”</p><p>See, my sword wasn’t my only weapon—I’d also packed a self-replicating virus just in case. As soon as the machine grinds to a halt, I pick up my sword and run as fast as my legs can carry me toward the location of the Flower Den.</p><p>I’m going to end this war.</p><p>I’m going to end it tonight.</p><p>I will never lose anyone I care about ever again.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Exploration<br>[<br>]</p><p>My journey to the Flower Den continues. It’s a long trek, but I just put my head down, follow the stolen map data in my device, and try to trust that I know what I’m doing.</p><p>From everything I can tell, the army actually brought the den under our control some time ago, but command didn’t send anyone in to investigate. That strikes me as strange, considering it would be the perfect time to learn how the Flowers live, so I intend to find out for myself.</p><p>As night fades and morning comes, I arrive at my destination and find corpses scattered throughout the area—most likely the soldiers who were first sent in to take the place. But aside from signs of an old battle, what catches my attention is the building that stretches into the air almost beyond where I can see. Though weathered and grungy, there’s a strangely majestic air about the place, and I try to tread lightly as I slip inside through a shattered door.</p><p>The building is dim inside, and large enough that I can’t see the ends of the rooms. The walls are sturdy, their faces lush with vines. As I make my way further in, the only light comes from small streams of morning sunshine that filter in through broken windows. The hallway is a never-ending stream of shattered glass, splintered wood, and rubble. But then…</p><p>“PLEASE. PLEASE.”</p><p>I hear a woman’s voice—barely a whisper.</p><p>“Hello?” I ask. “Is someone there?”</p><p>The only response I get from the darkness is silence. As I carefully proceed forward, the far end of the building finally comes into view.</p><p>“MERCY.”</p><p>The next voice is male. Multiple survivors, maybe? I scan my surroundings, looking for human forms, when suddenly…</p><p>“Okay, what the hell?”</p><p>Resting at the far wall are a series of tiny Flower sprouts. The faces in the juvenile petals distort in agony as they attempt to speak to me.</p><p>“SALVATION.”</p><p>Several voices speak at once. I know this is what happens to people who are consumed by Flowers—they become a part of the whole, unable to express their own will any longer.</p><p>“They aren’t human anymore,” I tell myself. “They’re not human, dammit. They’re Flowers.”</p><p>The sprouts lower their petals to reveal a series of twisted faces. The way they droop toward the ground gives the impression they’re praying.</p><p>“MOTHER. SAVE US, MOTHER.”</p><p>After a moment, I realize the things are actually praying. The subject of their reverence is a dilapidated altar upon which rests a grand portrait. It’s dirty enough I can’t tell what kind of person it’s supposed to show, but it makes my heart beat in my chest for a reason I can’t explain.</p><p>Why do I feel this way?</p><p>But no one is there to answer my question, and the only response is the continued whisper of frantic prayers.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Elimination<br>[<br>]</p><p>“AHH. AHH. EVERYONE IS DEAD.”</p><p>In the dingy building, the smallest Flower sniffles. A medium-sized one speaks to soothe it.</p><p>“ALL IS WELL, LITTLE ONE. THE MOTHER WILL SAVE US.”</p><p>“THE MOTHER? SHE WHO CREATED US?”</p><p>Voices of prayer fill the building anew. How eerie it sounds. How horrific. The ones who stole happiness from me and my family have no right to look for salvation.</p><p>“NO. NO. NO.”</p><p>I approach silently from behind, cutting down the young Flowers with faces. I kick their remains aside and approach the altar, staring at the dirty portrait atop it.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>I spy a book fallen behind the altar. Someone’s diary. It’s tattered, the writing faded in places, but some pages are still legible.</p><p>“A Flower…religion?”</p><p>I’d heard about such things before. People believed the Flowers would save the world, and so began to worship them. It seems I had found one of their temples.</p><p>I carefully turn the pages so as not to tear the fragile paper. For a time, those who worshipped the Flowers took in young Flowers and lived alongside them in this place. But they were all eaten in the end, leaving behind only a mass of Flowers to continue a meaningless prayer without end.</p><p>As my eyes continue to scan the diary, I spot the word “portrait.” My hurried hands come to a stop and I read, transfixed.</p><p>That portrait was apparently one of the religion’s symbols, one as revered and important as the Flowers themselves. But why did they find it so precious?</p><p>I find my answer on the final page. The people in the portrait were the ones charge of Flower research—the ones who brought those monsters into the world. Their names…</p><p>“No. I don’t believe this. It’s<br>impossible<br>.”</p><p>I walk up to the altar and wipe away as much of the dirt as possible. Faces slowly appear from beneath the grime. I’m greeted with cold, tense expressions. Though the air about her is different, she looks<br>exactly like HER<br>.</p><p>I reel, staggering to keep myself upright. As my hand comes to rest on the frame, I hear something fall.</p><p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p><p>This building is a ruin; not surprising that it’s falling apart. But as I look to the ceiling, I see something writhing in the dark.</p><p>Those are…</p><p>I first thought the ceiling was covered in vines, but I was mistaken. Instead, an infinite number of juvenile Flowers have tangled together to create a roof.</p><p>They rush me as one, crying out in voices of madness. I cut them down as I run, barely escaping with my life. But it was all worth it, for I now have evidence for the theory that Flowers are sentient. This data will be a huge boon to our research—it might even be the thread that finally leads to use eliminating them once and for all.</p><p>And yet, even knowing this, I set fire to the church, burning the Flowers and erasing the portrait from existence. The crimson flames howl in the billowing wind. They swallow the building whole, reducing everything within to ash and bone.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Erase<br>[<br>]</p><p>Once I burn the church, I set off on the long road back to the base where my wife is waiting, arriving after the sun has set.</p><p>I can’t get caught. I<br>can’t<br>. They’re still after me because I’m technically a deserter. Cautious of my surroundings, I creep back to our room.</p><p>“You’re back!”</p><p>She’s been waiting for me the entire time, and looks exhausted as she leaps from her chair.</p><p>“We need to get out of here,” I reply. She’s bewildered, but I don’t wait for her to start gathering our things. I quickly pack the photo of our son, followed by his mementos. After that, I grab some portable rations I’d pilfered on a mission once, just in case.</p><p>“Get out of here and go<br>where<br>?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Her bewilderment grows at my answer.</p><p>“You can’t just vanish, then reappear out of nowhere and say we have to leave!”</p><p>I probably would have said the same in her shoes.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll keep this short, but you have to listen.”</p><p>I tell her what I saw in the church. I tell her about the bizarre Flower buds, the altar, and the portrait. The portrait of the woman who looks exactly like my wife—the one they call “Mother.”</p><p>“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?” my wife asks quietly. “I mean, that’s just not possible.”</p><p>She’s right. She fights against the Flowers. She can’t be their mother.</p><p>“The superior officers are hiding something.”</p><p>They must have known what was in that church-turned-Flower den, yet they chose not to send a survey team. I can’t understand why; all I feel is an ominous sensation gripping my entire being.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>I zip the bag shut and hold out a hand. But then…</p><p>“He has admitted to coming across top-secret information.”</p><p>That’s all she says in return. A moment later, the door swings open and commanders fall into place behind her.</p><p>“I believe he found it sometime between the evening previous and this morning. But erase two days’ worth of memories, just in case.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The commanders do as she says and grab me.</p><p>“Wait! Why are you—!?”</p><p>Ordering around commanding officers? Trying to erase my memory?<br> Before I can ask, my mouth is gagged and I’m pinned to the floor. I realize my mistake then: It isn’t the superior officers who are hiding something.</p><p>“This is for your sake,” she whispers.</p><p>A cold rod stings to my neck as a shock courses through my body. In the instinctual fear of death, my life begins to flash before my eyes.</p><p>I see my wife’s smile.</p><p>Her tear-streaked cheeks.</p><p>Her face colored with anger.</p><p>I thought I knew everything about her, but the look on her face right now is cold and distant.</p><p>Just like the woman in the portrait.</p><p>As the darkness swallows my consciousness, I remain oblivious to her intentions—and her truth.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Enthralling Love<br>[<br>]</p><p>A prisoner who fights Flowers for revenge…Wow!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Argo"><a href="#Argo" class="headerlink" title="Argo"></a>Argo</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>My life’s mission is to explore the entire world, for only great hardships can make me feel alive. Everything besides adventuring is merely a footnote. I wager I’ll feel this way until the day I die.</p><p>I’ve faced the challenge of many unexplored regions in my life: Mountains untrodden by man, scorched deserts, frozen islands, pitch-black forests, caves that lead to an endless abyss… So many adventures I can’t even remember them all.</p><p>Just the other day, my wife and I learned that our long-awaited first child was in her belly! Of course, I wanted to help however I could. Which is why I left our snug house in the snowy mountains and began the long climb down. My destination is a small nearby town. How long has it been since I’ve made this trip? My wife is usually the one who does the shopping. In any case, I don’t mind doing what I must to help out during this time.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I haven’t tasted the bustle of civilization in a long while, but I pay it little mind as I search for the shops my wife told me about. Heh. It’s funny how quickly I get turned around in the streets—if only I was navigating a mountain path instead!</p><p>As I wander about, a merchant calls me over. He recognizes me as a renowned adventurer, and he says he has items he wants me to look at. He has a keen eye, this shopkeeper! Ha ha ha! The shopkeep lays out several items across his display: flint to create bonfires, a talisman that wards off illness, and ice that never melts, even under the hottest of suns. All extremely useful items on any adventure! He claims these items are all in high demand, so I buy them on the spot. Lady luck is really smiling on me today!</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The moment I leave the stall, reality smacks me in the face: I spent all our money and didn’t get a thing my wife wanted! Ah, well. Nothing to be done about it now. So I sell my coat and use the money to buy what I came for. Not the smartest thing to go coatless in the dead of winter, but I’m hearty—I’ll find a way to survive. Mine is a body forged in the fires of countless journeys. It’d take more than this to do me in!</p><p>As I make my way back up the mountain, a blizzard suddenly comes upon me. I’m cold—<br> cold—but I spy a nearby rocky shelter and decide to hunker down. As I settle in, I try to start a bonfire with my new flint. But the moment I strike it, the damn thing shatters into pieces. It’s a dud—talk about unlucky.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Somehow, I manage to make it home through the wind and snow. When my wife sees me, she demands to know why I was wandering around without my coat on, so I tell her the whole crazy story. Still, I’m pretty excited about my two remaining treasures!</p><p>That night, I am plagued by a high fever. You expect this kind of thing when you walk around in a blizzard without a coat, but it means my talisman that wards off illness is<br> a bust! Another dud! Can you believe it? Trying to kill the fever dead, I put my never-melt ice in a sack and set it on my forehead. I bet you can guess how this goes… I take the bag of lukewarm water off my head and toss it aside in disgust. That damn shopkeep took me for all I had! Still, it’s not all a loss; I live on a snowy mountain… So if it’s ice I need, I just have to walk outside! Ha ha ha ha ha!</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Mittens—Just in Case Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Before he met an unfortunate end</p><p>Icicles hang from the eaves. The world outside is enrobed in white. The snow here is deep and cold. The trees, bushes, and grasses all lie buried, silently waiting for the arrival of spring.</p><p>A girl of tender age gazes out the window. “Here you go, honey.”</p><p>The girl turns to face the speaker and finds her mother offering her a cup with steam furling from the top. It’s filled with warm goat milk. Her mother swears by it, claiming it’s the best thing for warding off winter’s chill. But the girl doesn’t feel strongly about it one way or the other.</p><p>“Uh, thanks,” she says.</p><p>She accepts the cup from her mother and returns her attention to the outside world, taking small sips now and then.</p><p>“I wonder when your father will come home,” murmurs her mother.</p><p>Without waiting for a response, she quietly retreats back to the kitchen. The girl exhales on the window, her breath warm from the milk. It clouds over in white. She runs her finger across the spot, sketching idle patterns. She is not allowed to play outside during the winter, so boredom is her constant companion. During such times, even a window can make a decent playmate. The girl lets her attention drift as she looks out the window at the piles of snow beyond.</p><p>Her small house sits halfway up a snowy mountain. The girl and her mother are usually the only occupants. Her father is rarely home. According to her mother, he is an adventurer of sorts who is always off traveling the world. The girl isn’t sure what kind of job an “adventurer” is, exactly—all she knows is that her father is very busy. But her mother has a litany of complaints about him, and she is never shy to make her opinions known.</p><p>“Your father never listens! He’s stubborn as a mule, drunk as a skunk, and he never, ever, EVER thinks about his family! He only cares about his damn adventures!”</p><p>And she always finishes her rant with the same exasperated phrase:</p><p>“I honestly don’t know what to do with that man.”</p><p>The girl is too young to speak with her mother as an equal. But as her mother has no one else to talk to, she grumbles away—as much to herself as her daughter most days.</p><p>Recently, her mother told the girl a story. Four years ago, when the girl was born, her father had apparently been off on one of his adventures.</p><p>“Wait,” said the girl when she first learned of this.</p><p>“So you gave birth to me<br>alone<br>?”</p><p>Her mother replied with a chuckle.</p><p>“Oh, I knew he wouldn’t come home, so I made sure to call a midwife up from town ahead of time.”</p><p>The girl nodded as though she understood and said, “Gee, Mom. That’s pretty crazy.”</p><p>When the father finally returned from that freewheeling adventure, his daughter could already hold her head up on her own. After that, her mother raised her almost entirely alone. The girl would always gaze in bewilderment at her father during his rare visits home, and figured that perhaps his behavior was normal, and that’s just what fathers are. But she could not help but feel concern by the dark look that often fell upon her mother’s face. She doesn’t hate her father. Not really, anyway. But once she became old enough to understand some things, she started to resent the way he treated her mother. One year, her father came home before the arrival of spring.</p><p>That was the night it happened. It led to one of the worst moments of her life. The three of them sat around the table enjoying a meal. Suddenly, her father—drunk as usual—leaned over to her and said:</p><p>“Y’know, if you were a boy, I’d take ya on an adventure with me.”</p><p>Before she knew it, her eyes were filled with tears.<br>Why am I crying about this?<br> she wondered.<br>For a moment, her mind was a blazing whirl of emotion. Her father had laughed the whole thing off, claiming it was a joke and ruffling her hair. But it was no joke to her; as far as she was concerned, her father had denied her very existence. As the days passed, another emotion began to bud within the girl, one far different from her usual sadness and isolation. It was a spirit of defiance toward her father.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Mittens—Just in Case Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>“Y’know, if you were a boy, I’d take ya on an adventure with me.”</p><p>Two years have passed since her father hollowed out her heart. Though she is older now, she still lives alone with her mother. Her father continues to live his life of freedom, stumbling home whenever the mood strikes.</p><p>Why does Dad like adventures so much?</p><p>Why does Dad think they’re more important than Mom?</p><p>Why does Dad hate me?</p><p>These questions often enter the girl’s mind before she falls asleep. But one of her lean years can never find the answer.</p><p>Eventually, as always, her father wanders home. When he crashes through the door, he hands over all sorts of random articles to her mother. They’re a mix of strange statues, odd flowers, and a dozen other useless trinkets—but he refers to them proudly as his “spoils.”</p><p>“Sell ‘em for money!” her father says proudly.</p><p>But the girl knows from her mother that his “spoils” are near to worthless. In the end, her mother always paid their living expenses by knitting clothes and gloves and selling them in town. But of course, her father has no idea. She asked her mother once why she didn’t tell her father this, and she just shook her head.</p><p>“Those spoils are important to him. If he ever realized they were junk, it would make him terribly upset.”</p><p>After handing over his most recent spoils, her father gulps down strong alcohol with dinner. Though he is usually silent on his first night back, this time he gleefully spins tales of his adventures. Ever since the incident of two years ago, the girl had avoided her father when he drank. She couldn’t bear having him say something so cruel again. That’s why she rarely hears his adventuring tales directly. But his booming voice is impossible to avoid in the small house, and it reaches her as she lies in bed. He raves about fighting a ferocious beast in a scorching volcano, claims to have discovered ancient ruins in a deep wood, and weaves a tale of a titan’s mirage in a land of illusion.</p><p>“Bet I would love these stories if I was a BOY,” mutters the girl.</p><p>Annoyed, she closes her eyes and waits for sleep. She occasionally hears her mother make indistinct noises to indicate she’s following along—either because she’s used to such stories after all the years, or because she’s simply tired of hearing them. Soon, her parents start to argue. This is another part of his coming-home “routine.” The cause of their argument is always some trivial matter, mostly involving a supposed hurt suffered by her father.</p><p>“Are you even listening to me!?”</p><p>“This is important!”</p><p>Things like that. Yet to a child, every argument is a new round of pain. Whenever he starts yelling, she feels such empathy for her mother that her entire soul is plunged into a whirlpool of fear and unease. She pulls her blanket over her head and wraps it tight around her ears in an attempt to block out his drunken howls.<br>I wish he’d never come home.</p><p>Soon, she hears her father yell, “Adventuring is my life, woman!” followed by the familiar slam of a door. The argument had ended as it always did. With sleep miles away, the girl slips out of bed and makes her way to her mother, who is sitting silently at the kitchen table.</p><p>“I’m okay, honey,” she says with a slight smile.</p><p>“Go back to bed.”</p><p>Relieved, the girl returns to her bedroom and quickly falls asleep. She thought her father might stick around for a bit this time, but he sets off again in the middle of the night. And she knows that when he returns, he’ll cheerfully drink his favorite drinks, wolf down some food, and argue with her mother. The same pathetic pattern; an endless, worthless cycle. Why did he do the same thing over and over? And why did her mother put up with it? She did not understand at first. One day, the mother said to the girl, “That’s just who your father is.”</p><p>To the girl, it looked as though her mother was forcing a smile. The girl eventually summed it up in a single thought:<br>“I guess that’s just what it’s like to be married.”</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Mittens—Just in Case Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Days pass. Months pass. How many winters has it been now? As always, she drinks her warm goat milk and stares out the window at nothing of particular importance. Giant trees. Mysterious animals. Colorful flowers. Creepy insects. From spring to autumn, the whole outdoors surrounding their home is her special place. She spends her days covered in mud as she runs through the mountains, following her curiosity wherever it leads. But winter? Well, winter is different. Deep banks of snow confine the girl to her house; her world shrinks down to a single fogged-over window. She hates winter. She hates it with all that she is.</p><p>This winter, her mother is nearing full term with her second child. But her father is off wandering the world again, so the two of them are home alone. Despite her pregnancy, her mother stays busy with housework and knitting. The girl understands this is what supports them both, and does her best to play alone and out of the way. But the house is so very<br>boring<br>. Lately, she’s been whittling herself small toys out of wood, but that can only pass the time for so long. Today, the girl simply sits and waits for the day to end.</p><p>Eventually, her gaze leaves the window and wanders about. This room, with the large table and fireplace, is where she and her mother—and occasionally her father—take their meals. Bottles of her father’s drinks sit in a row on the mantle. They almost seem lonely, as if wondering why no one has yet popped their corks to enjoy the wonders within. In the kitchen, something bubbles merrily away. Her mother is preparing dinner. Though there is still milk in her cup, she sets it on the table and wanders off to find a different room to play in. Sadly, the house is not very large. She arrives at her destination within seconds. A tired wooden door stands before her. And on the other side…is a mystery. Boredom has made the girl bold. This is the only room in the house she has never seen. It is her father’s room. He has forbidden anyone else from entering it.</p><p>“I have important things in there,” he often said,</p><p>“and I don’t need you fiddling around.”</p><p>“He is<br>definitely<br> hiding something,” says the girl to no one.</p><p>She feels years of defiance and resentment boiling up, and suddenly wants to open that door more than anything. But if her mother catches her, she will be very upset. Her mother takes promises with her father seriously, after all. That was why she snuck past her mother in the kitchen and approached the door on feet as quiet as a cat. Before her, a door. Behind it, a space for her father alone. She can hear her own heartbeat. Sweat glistens on her palms. She is nervous about disobeying her father, but also about learning his secrets.</p><p>Finally, the girl pushes the ill-fitted wooden door ajar, slips through the gap, and closes it behind her. The room is silent in the absence of its owner. It is also exceedingly plain, with only a bed, a desk, and a small assortment of adventuring tools. She begins her exploration at the desk. It is covered with a messy stack of papers. There is a date scrawled on each. The girl flips through the papers idly. They are records of his adventures. The rough handwriting belies the fact he wrote them all himself. Each story tells of dangers faced on his travels; of moments that mark the line between life and death. They tell what he thought, what he did, and how he felt. They also speak of all the marvelous sights he has seen. They’re so detailed, it’s like the girl is there with him. She digs deeper and deeper into the pile before finally reaching the bottom, where she finds a paper from one year in particular: The year she was born. She opens the record and begins to read—and as she does, her heart leaps into her throat.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Mittens—Just in Case Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>I was very young when I first snuck into Dad’s room. He had a pile of writings there, but one in particular spoke to me. The date on the cover was from the year I was born. My name was written at the top, and below that was paragraph after paragraph of kind words for his beloved child. I’d often doubted he even remembered me at all, so I held it tight and read furiously.</p><p>I want to show my beloved daughter all the secrets that slumber in this wide, wide world. I want to prove to her that I have lived. And I want her to know how so very beautiful the world can be.</p><p>That’s why I’m writing down my adventures starting today: So that someday she can know all this for herself.</p><p>My only wish is that her life be filled with joy and wonder. I would give anything for that.</p><p>Dad was a large, loud, awkward man. And he was<br>terrible<br> at expressing his feelings—especially love. But in that moment… I suddenly understood him. The date on that entry was three months after my birthday.</p><p>Mom told me he was off adventuring the day I was born. He must have written it when he came back. That’s just the kind of man he was. After that, my impression of him changed. Once I knew he loved me—<br>really<br> knew it—my feelings of defiance and revulsion slowly began to change. A few days after I snuck into his room, he came home. Like always, he got hammered, fought with Mom, and stomped off to his room. I was still young, and though I understood him a little bit better, I hadn’t had time to process everything yet, so I was still annoyed. It was hard to hear them fight—especially because I knew how much it hurt Mom. And like I said, I was still processing everything. But somehow I mustered up the courage to give him a present.</p><p>It was the next morning, just as he was heading out. The snow was heavy that day. I woke up early, walked outside, and handed him a letter and a good-luck charm I’d carved out of wood. It was the first present I’d ever given him, and he looked a little shocked to receive it. But then he smiled at me, muttered an awkward thank-you, and tucked them both away in one of his pockets. That smile made me feel like my heart was going to burst. Then he walked over the horizon and disappeared. I was euphoric, flying, so I ran back inside and asked Mom to teach me how to knit. I wanted to make him a pair of mittens for when he got back. I’d never given a damn about knitting before, but now making something nice for Dad was all I could think about. Maybe I thought it would make up for all the coldness I’d shown him over the years. Unfortunately… I was never able to give him those mittens. Because after he left that day, he never came back.</p><p>I’ve been waiting for ten years now.</p><p>“You’re back! You’re back! Tell me a story! An ADVENTURE story!”</p><p>When I open the door and enter the house, my little brother runs up and attaches himself to my leg. He’s far happier than I ever was at that age—and why not? He’s healthy and loved and has the whole outdoors as his playground. But unlike me, all he knows about Dad are his stories.</p><p>“I’m gonna be an adventurer just like you, Sis!”</p><p>I now travel the world as a fledgling adventurer. And on the occasions I make it home, I always make sure to spin my brother a tale or three. The records my father left behind are my most precious treasures. Mom was beside herself when I told her I was going to be an adventurer, but she eventually came around; you can only fight what’s in your blood for so long, you know?</p><p>I still remember what Dad said that night:</p><p>“Y’know, if you were a boy, I’d take ya on an adventure with me.”</p><p>I hated him in that moment—and it took a long, long time for that hate to finally drain away. And while I couldn’t express what I felt when I was a kid, I can put it into words now. He was wrong. I<br>knew<br> he was wrong. And I wanted him to admit it. So I’m going to prove to him that a woman can be just as skilled an adventurer as any man….Heh. I guess I really am his daughter, huh? Anyway, if I ever find him out there in this great, wide world, I’ll do what Mom would do and give him holy hell. And each time I set out for some new and unseen land, I pray this is the time where it will finally happen. And of course, I always carry the mittens.</p><p>…You know.

They stand there proudly as they stretch up to the sky, and the color reminds all who pass of blood. But these spikes are not there to keep intruders at bay; our family has no need of such defenses. None ever approach our house, which is known as The Demon’s Den. And if some foolhardy brigand ever did so dare, he would soon learn that death on the spikes is much, much sweeter than what awaits behind our doors. No, the spikes are not meant to keep people out; they are there to keep the demons in.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>Our training is harsh. Our work cruel. Our teachings inhumane. One might expect that there would be those who are unable to stand it, and scheme to escape. And in fact, there have been a few brave souls who attempted to cross the wall. But every single one of them was killed; the crimson spikes remind us of this fact.</p><p>I personally knew one man who plotted escape. He was the elder brother of the lord in power—my uncle.</p><p>My uncle objected to an assassination demanded of him. But when he tried to flee, he met the same fate as those who did so before him: his head put on display for all to see.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>My family’s teachings are impossibly strict—and as the daughter of the lord, I was not exempt. If anything, my teachings were even more severe. It was only natural given my standing. There are no smiles in a house of assassins; we are showered with naught but shouting and demands.</p><p>My uncle, however, always had time to spare a grin for me. He was the only one who ever did. But on that grim day, his smile vanished. His younger brother cut him down to set an example, and his face would forevermore be frozen in a rictus of pain. I learned many hard truths that day: I would never cross the spikes. Kindness has no meaning. My life is nothing but orders and blood.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Time passed and I took over the household from my father.

Her finger notes the light sensation of blade against bone. It is so very familiar. This feeling—one honed to a science while taking countless lives—is the sensation of death. Her life has been spent with a blade in her hands, and she does not intend to fail now. She puts pressure on her middle and ring fingers, while the rest curl tightly around the hilt. Almost as if they are drawing in the death she senses. The bones will separate. The head will fall. The—“Hang on.” Woman and blade alike pause at the voice. The voice, high in tone like a ringing bell, continued.</p><p>“Leave the head. With mackerel, you don’t take the head off until you’re ready to remove the rest of the guts.”</p><p>The woman with the knife replies with a question:</p><p>“And what of the bones?”</p><p>“It’s okay to cut those, but don’t separate it entirely.”</p><p>“Cooking is very different from killing,” muses the woman.</p><p>“Yeah, I suppose it would be,” replies the speaker.</p><p>They giggle slightly while imparting this bit of wisdom. The setting sun floods the room with persimmon light. It is a small interval between the sweltering summer and the coolness of autumn. The sun flees the world earlier each day. And as the day takes its leave, night stretches out greedy fingers to reclaim what was stolen in the dawn. The speaker continues.</p><p>“Once you’ve taken out the innards, you can move on to the bloodline.”</p><p>“Bloodline?”</p><p>The woman stands, knife in hand, and awaits an answer. She typically wielded her blade on a battlefield, not in a kitchen, and is unable to find a comfortable grip on the paring knife.</p><p>“Apparently it’s muscle. See the dark red parts there?”</p><p>“The bloodline… An apt name.”</p><p>A girl of about sixteen—the speaker—peers over the shoulder of the woman with the knife and smiles, her long hair fluttering.</p><p>“Does my cooking amuse you?” asks the woman.</p><p>She stares at the cooking board as she says it, but her annoyance is clear.</p><p>“Heh heh. It<br>is<br> cute to see someone who’s so cool in a fight have trouble with a mackerel.”</p><p>The girl grins as she says this, lighting up the room. Ashamed, the woman looks away. This only serves to delight the girl all the more.</p><p>“I’m obviously no expert,” says the woman.</p><p>“I did not grow up doing such things.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, I’d never done it either until that day.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The woman knows this well. With nothing to say in return, she falls to silence.</p><p>That day.</p><p>The two of them know exactly what this means.</p><p>Five years ago. Early summer.</p><p>Heavy rain blanketed the sky. It was the day the assassin met the girl—her target. She was going to take her life as she had countless others. The girl was ready to die; perhaps she even sought it. But the woman did not kill her. Call it a whim. But that day—that whim—had brought them to where they are now. Theirs is a relationship forged in checkered fate. They had both cast aside their own lives to form this new one, where each day stretches out in quiet solitude. In the distance, a cricket begins to stir.</p><p>“Hey, I’m sorry,” says the girl.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have teased you.”</p><p>“You’re the only one who actually<br>works<br> around here anyway, so thank you. I really appreciate it.”</p><p>The woman turns to look over her shoulder at her young companion.</p><p>“Flattery will get you nowhere…”</p><p>Turning away once more, she utters a weak protest. But the girl knows this action is an admittance of defeat, and her radiant smile lights up anew.</p><p>“Enough foolishness. Tell me what to do with this creature.”</p><p>“Well, you took the bloodline out, so now you have to wash it.”</p><p>The woman nods, picks the fish up off the cutting board, and dips it into a pail of cool water.<br>Blood seeps out of the mackerel, staining the water a faint red.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Song of Imprisonment Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The flower reaches to the heavens above,</p><p>gazing at the brilliant sun and indulging in fantasy.</p><p>It will do so until the time comes that it blackens and withers,</p><p>finally learning that it will never reach the sky.</p><p>Petals unfurl.

The girl, however, is taken aback.</p><p>“Uh… Well, sure? But mackerel’s a bluefish, so you have to get the smell out…”</p><p>She is attempting to teach the woman a dish called mackerel miso. It is not a particularly difficult dish to make, and perfect for teaching someone how to handle fish. This is why the girl selected it.</p><p>“Now we let it rest, correct?”</p><p>She confirms each step of the process with the girl. They had divided responsibilities since they began living together. The woman has learned well her young charge’s skill in the kitchen.</p><p>“Yep! Once the salt gets in there, it’ll draw out the moisture.”</p><p>But the girl has not always been skilled at cooking. It was a task she threw herself into after meeting the woman, and her first few years were littered with failed attempts. But now, five years later, she has acquired much culinary skill; this is both a testament to her hard work and proof of the time the two of them have spent together.</p><p>“Then removing the moisture also takes away the smell?”</p><p>“You got it! Oh, and we’re also going to parboil it, so might as well get the water ready in the meantime.”</p><p>The girl pauses and knits her fingers together, looking at the woman shyly.</p><p>“So, um…have you ever actually<br>done<br> that?”</p><p>The woman’s earlier comment is clearly still weighing on her.</p><p>“Torture, you mean? Hmm, not really.”</p><p>“Oh! Oh. Well, um… That’s good?”</p><p>“Killing was my job.”</p><p>“Torture would be the domain of another.”</p><p>The conversation takes the girl back once more to that day. She remembers how the woman saved her life by taking out an entire battalion of samurai. Afterward, the young girl somehow managed to drag her unconscious savior out of the castle. She grabbed all the gold coin she could carry from her house, and hurried in search of a doctor. Soaked from heavy rain and the woman’s blood, her legs threatening to snap under her burden, she screamed for help until her throat was raw. As the woman lay bleeding on a tatami mat, she had said four words to the girl: “Live as you please.”</p><p>No one had ever said such a thing to her. She did not even know it was an option. That was why she sought so desperately to save the woman: because she<br>wanted<br> to. But what the girl knows of the woman is only what she saw on that day, and on the days since. How much pain and hardship had she truly experienced? The girl had felt a sudden awareness of the distance between them.</p><p>A flock of birds flies off into the late summer sunset. Dark shadows bleed across the kitchen like spilled ink.</p><p>“Sorry,” says the girl.</p><p>“That was a weird question.”</p><p>“I probably shouldn’t ask about… You know. That stuff.”</p><p>The woman does not think fondly of her past. The girl is very aware of this. But this night, it does not seem to bother her overmuch.</p><p>“It’s all right. I don’t mind the question.” The girl hesitates.</p><p>“Yeah, but…” She does not like being placated.</p><p>If someone wants to tell her no, it’s far better for them to simply do so instead of pretending. But the woman is smiling, and the girl slowly realizes she actually does mean it after all.</p><p>“I may hide my past, but that doesn’t make it go away.” The girl listens intently.</p><p>“Besides, the two of us have few secrets from each other at this point, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p>The woman’s eyes form a pair of crescent moons as she smiles. Her answer—and her smile—fill the hole in the girl’s heart.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Satisfied, the woman turns away. The girl stares at her back and mutters: “…You’re too good at that.”</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Song of Imprisonment Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Some say a flower is most beautiful when its petals begin to fall.</p><p>Yet death is inevitable, and holds no value in itself.</p><p>We reach out our hands, seeking beauty.</p><p>But obtaining it can be a difficult thing,</p><p>and the quest often shows us our limits.</p><p>It is naught but delusion to recall failures to reach beauty as having been beautiful themselves.</p><p>Thus does humanity continue to err in order to console itself.</p><p>—A Poem of Melded Imprisonment</p><p>As the sun sinks below the horizon, hints of night begin to draw over the land. More crickets strike up a chorus in anticipation of the moon. Soon, another sound joins them in harmony. The girl cocks her head as she stirs the pot.</p><p>“Those are giant katydids.”</p><p>“You certainly know this land,” replies the woman.</p><p>She is busy rubbing the sliced skin of the mackerel to remove the oil.</p><p>“Yeah, I just read about them in a book.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. You’ve acquired quite a collection of used books.”</p><p>The two of them live near a forest that is some distance from the closest town. Both due to lack of other diversions, and because of her own passion for reading, the girl was often seen passing the time with book in hand.</p><p>“Just doing some studying. I’ve been thinking it’s about time I looked for work.” The girl smiles brightly.</p><p>“Hmm. That’s how it usually goes, is it?”</p><p>There is a tinge of sadness to the woman’s response. The woman had been “working” from before the age the girl is now. She killed her first man when she was not even ten. But murder is the only work she knows—the mundane worries of a normal, day-to-day job are unknown to her.</p><p>“Okay, I think the mackerel should be ready now.”</p><p>The girl pulls her ladle from the pot, which is bubbling merrily away. The woman stands beside her, holding a towel.</p><p>“Go ahead and put it in there and let’s give it a boil.”</p><p>“Got it.”</p><p>The woman’s voice has a tinge of excitement, which causes the girl to smile. Wielding a large pair of cooking chopsticks even more uncomfortably than she did the knife, she manages to transfer the fillet to the pot.</p><p>“Make sure to put the skin face-up.”</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>“Yep! Now throw some ginger in there and put the lid on.”</p><p>The woman follows the girl’s instructions with awkward movements. But the dexterity of her fingers is cause for wonder. Perhaps it comes from her horrifying past.</p><p>“So how is work, anyway?”</p><p>The girl watches the pot while she asks the question.</p><p>“Much easier than my old job. I may end up losing my edge.”</p><p>The woman flexes her hands as she speaks.</p><p>There was only one thing she could mean: the martial arts. She is a master of weapons large and small, and her technique and experience made her a formidable foe. And now, she uses those skills to make her living. She takes on occasional work as a bodyguard, or teaches young royals in the way of the sword. At times, she faces down death once again. It makes her feel that she is still the same killer she always was, but in these times in which they live, it is difficult to avoid. And compared to her past, at least, working as a mercenary is much less taxing. Theirs is an era of turbulence and upheaval where people rarely stay put for long, yet they had managed to build a home.</p><p>“I’m glad it’s going well,” says the girl. The girl smiles at the woman.</p><p>“So when you say you’re going to look for work,” begins the woman, “is it because…”</p><p>Something about the girl’s words and smiles doesn’t sit right with the woman. It’s almost as if her young companion feels indebted.</p><p>“Listen,” she says, “you don’t have to feel guilty. You’ve lived a hard life. You deserve to take it easy for a while.”</p><p>Before she can finish her thought—which was going to be “it’s not as if we’re struggling”—the girl cuts her off.</p><p>“I could say the same for you.”</p><p>“But you don’t need to worry about—“</p><p>“Stop. You don’t understand.”</p><p>The girl places her hand on the woman’s wrist. Their eyes meet. The girl holds her gaze, looking right into the woman’s eyes.</p><p>“I just want us to be a team.”<br>She was smiling as she said it. So the woman said no more.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Song of Imprisonment Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>One earns many scars over a long life.</p><p>There is much we learn and much we regret—</p><p>and none of us emerge unscathed.</p><p>So long as we live, our scars continue to grow.</p><p>Those who surrender to this truth eventually find themselves merely going through the motions of reaching out their arms.</p><p>For the hand of an empty husk has no will to grasp anything.</p><p>The reason flowers look so beautiful in our eyes—</p><p>“Sorry.

The setting sun turns mountains and trees into silhouettes.</p><p>“It sure is! Time to chow down.”</p><p>The girl answers the question in a firm voice, as if to emphasize they have finished.</p><p>“Nice. It looks delicious.”</p><p>Though she did have the girl’s help, this was her first time having cooked a meal herself. Her eyes sparkled just as much as the girl’s. The girl takes up some tableware and passes it to the woman.</p><p>“Well? You’re the chef here—time to serve up your creation!”</p><p>“Is there a particular way it should be served?”</p><p>“It’s just a single dish of one type of food, and we’re the only ones eating, so I guess it doesn’t really matter.”</p><p>Using the ladle, she gently scoops up a portion of the well-boiled mackerel and places it onto the plates. She pours more of the broth over them, and sprinkles chopped green onion on top. The dish is complete. The woman gazes at her plate as if truly moved. The scent of miso and ginger causes her stomach to rumble.</p><p>“It’s getting pretty dark, so let’s hurry up and eat. I’ve already set up the rest.”</p><p>As she talks, the girl carries the rice bowls and her plate to the living room. The woman follows, carrying her own plate. They arrange themselves on cushions and press their palms together in thanks.</p><p>“Time to eat!” cries the girl.</p><p>“Time to eat indeed,” replies the woman. Rice bowl in hand, the girl asks the woman a question.</p><p>“Hey, so what made you want to cook today?”</p><p>Though she had chosen the dish and provided instruction, it had been the woman’s idea for them to do so. While she had helped in the kitchen over the past five years, she had never once mentioned wanting to cook herself.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know,” says the woman as she nibbles her rice.</p><p>“Work just finished up early today.”</p><p>“Well… That, and…”</p><p>The rice seems to stick in her throat, but she forces it down.</p><p>“This was something I used to see a lot.”</p><p>It was something she experienced back when she was an assassin.</p><p>“I would see families talking about what to have for dinner, or parents cooking with their children, or…”</p><p>She trails off, lost in thought. She had witnessed these scenes as she passed to missions or from them, peering at happy families behind lamp-lit windows. And for a child who had never seen her own parents smile, it seemed a world almost impossibly out of reach.</p><p>“I thought I would never have a life like that.”</p><p>The woman sighs softly. The girl sits quietly and listens.</p><p>“So I suppose I wanted to see what it was like.”</p><p>Once she says this, the woman cast her eyes down, seemingly at a loss for words. Silence spreads across the room. If not for the cries of insects, time would have no meaning. More silence. Finally, the woman breaks it.</p><p>“I just wanted to stand in a kitchen with someone like we did today.”</p><p>She smiles to hide her embarrassment—something the girl has never seen her do before.</p><p>“I see,” says the girl.</p><p>Her reaction is neutral, expressing neither sympathy nor empathy. She then asks a single question:</p><p>“So… How’s the food you made yourself?”</p><p>It is enough. They share a smile.</p><p>“Sweet, actually.

Though they steal my attention, the bright sunlight causes me to shut my eyes. When I open them again, I find the leaves have drifted to the children’s feet. They pay them no mind. Perhaps they do not even notice.</p><p>I watch them dance.</p><p>It is Hypnotic.</p><p>Beneath the open sky, behind a wall topped by ominous red spikes, children yell as they scamper to and fro. Their movements are clumsy due to their immature limbs and musculature, but their energetic voices still echo across the sky. Passers-by outside the wall hear them and smile, remembering the halcyon days of their own childhoods.</p><p>But the passers-by do not see what they are holding.</p><p>Each child carries a deadly steel blade in one hand. They stand in a triangular formation so they might better observe one another. It is the custom of this family for even the youngest child to wield true steel at all times, save when sparring one another. This is because we must think of out weapons as extension of our own bodies.</p><p>All for the sake of our lord.</p><p>I sigh and look away. A man who had been standing separate from the children meets my gaze and bows—their teacher, most likely. I respond with a brief wave of my hand.</p><p>The family I now lead is an organization of killers. We are killers who support our lord’s rule from the shadows, having polished our skills for decades so we might ensure that his rule is absolute. We are comprised of many generations of blood relatives, as well as supporting staff. Though I hear tell the family was not always so large, it has now grown in size for various reasons: the expansion of territory, securing power for wartime, family feuds, preserving secrets, and so on.</p><p>The head of the household receives direct orders from our lord, while day-to-day management of the organization falls upon the previous lord—my father. But his work is not unrelated to my own; indeed, I hold a position where I have great sway over the futures of our young charges.</p><p>The children are training in assassination. The daggers at their belts and in their hands are common things found throughout the world, and nowhere near as suited for our work as a concealed weapon. But there are times when an assassin cannot choose their weapon. Perhaps they are not yet skilled in stealth, or perhaps their preferred weapon breaks during a mission. This lesson teaches them how to act in such unfortunate situations.</p><p>We have no choice in this.</p><p>Children will give their all to the cruelest regiments precisely because they are young and innocent. Their eyes do not yet perceive the weight of life, and this leads them down a path most dark.</p><p>It reminds me of my own past. Of the day I first took the  life of another. And if I close my eyes, I can still see my blood-soaked hands.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Orders<br>[<br>]</p><p>The horizon blurred, almost as if I was viewing it after a long and restless night. I stood in place, staring down at a pair of hands slick with scarlet. I had just killed someone, and this act would be a part of me forever.</p><p>I remember the day I came of age. Even though I would one day inherit our house, I was given a wooden sword and told to drill with one of my father’s many subordinates, no different than any other child in a samurai family.</p><p>My training was merciless, and I endured it day and night without pause. All that time, I pretended not to notice the cheerful sounds of children playing beyond the walls. In hindsight, I realize my instructor’s irritable demeanor and harsh methods were not because he wished to see me succeed, but because he hated my being heir to our house.</p><p>In one particularly brutal session, I watched the man’s swordsmanship closely before slipping through a gap in his swing. But a child’s meager strength and short limbs are no match for an adult—only after we quash our fundamental disadvantages can we first stand on equal footing.</p><p>The nearness of my tutor invited a mistake in judgment. No one in our family flounders when another enters their circle, and my instructor quickly shifted his pivot foot and continued to swipe at my legs. Frantic, I struck his kneecap with the handle of my wooden sword in an attempt to halt his momentum. My plan was to slip past him to the left, then send the blade into his side. But as I readied my next move, I saw him adjust the grip on his sword out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>It was too early to step out of the way, but too late to dodge. Almost without realizing it, I grabbed the man’s clothing and attempted to body slam him. But a child’s grapple means nothing without momentum; all the move did was bring my physical disadvantage to the fore.</p><p>Instantly regretting my mistake, I prepared myself for pain. But rather than deliver a blow, my instructor froze. I followed his widened eyes and turned to see the former head of the family: my father. He greeted my instructor, who sheathed his wooden sword and kneeled, then turned his attention to me.</p><p>“We must speak. Come.”</p><p>My father brought me to the parlor and told me I was to be given a mission. While the news came as a shock, the cold weight in his tone said all I needed to know about the nature of the task.</p><p>“I wish to acknowledge my daughter’s maturity,” he said. “Before the week is out, you will choose a target and bring me their head. But know this: the value of the target determines your own worth.”</p><p>These words caused me to lift my head; while I had expected many possible missions, that had never been one of my considerations. Yet now I had five days to eliminate someone whose death might prove beneficial to my father and our house.</p><p>My mind reeled. Unable to reply, I bowed deeply and exited the room. The question of which life was the correct one to take held me tight, almost as if I had been seized and bound in a great and weighty chain.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Fate<br>[<br>]</p><p>If it was ever acceptable to measure the worth of another’s life, who would have the right to do so? Even if it is not acceptable, people still seek their own worth.</p><p>It is as though the value of one’s life is fixed.</p><p>I was given my first order to kill when I was yet young. The trial would serve as a display of our abilities, and involved us killing a target of our choosing.</p><p>I was allowed to venture into the city under supervision of people from the family in order to search for a target. While I sometimes left the house for espionage missions, such instances had been rare. This was the first time I was able to act and search of my own accord.</p><p>As I moved through the city, I recalled something my instructor said to me before I left on my mission:</p><p>Anyone can be killed if they are considered weak. Even you.</p><p>His meaning was clear: If I did not put my life on the line to satisfy my father, he would take it without any hesitation.</p><p>But I was so young, and the hesitation of taking a life combined with the pressure I felt in the face of my trial was enough to drive me into the proverbial corner.</p><p>And that fear bound my shadow to my house. How ironic.</p><p>As I searched for my target, I did my best to hide my trembling fingers in my fists. I wandered the boundary between light and dark, weaving the narrow alleyways between buildings as I tried to make my decision. It was as far from true freedom as one could be, yet I mistook it for such in those early days.</p><p>Removing this samurai will be more than enough to display my strength.</p><p>But I have never killed before. Can I do it?</p><p>That man drowns in unearned riches. His death will be easy and beneficial.</p><p>But is that enough to satisfy my father?</p><p>That merchant has earned great ire from the townsfolk. Many would want him dead.</p><p>Is it my place to make such a judgment?</p><p>My thoughts came to a dead end. I repeated the same actions over and over until the very last day, staring for hours at the boundary between light and dark.</p><p>When that last day came, I grew impatient. Where did I even go? I know I pursued my target with fevered desperation and a kind of awkwardness, and eventually my hesitation led me back home, where I stared at the weapons along the wall of my room and shivered.</p><p>Who can I kill?</p><p>Who is the right candidate?</p><p>Who is all right to kill?</p><p>How should I kill?</p><p>When should I kill?</p><p>Where should I kill?</p><p>In the end, perhaps the answer is for me to kill…<br>me<br>.</p><p>My family made children determine the value of a life, putting their very selves at risk in the process. Indeed, that was likely the purpose of the exercise. Will their sensibilities break under the weight? Will their spirits shatter under the pressure? Can they still bring profit to the family?</p><p>In the end, it taught me that hesitation in the face of a kill was unnecessary to those of my household. Perhaps it even served the purpose of destroying any worthless hopes and dreams.</p><p>I greeted the dawn of the final day with exhaustion and anguish. I had forgotten what it meant to be alive.</p><p>When I finally looked down, I realized my hands were soaked with blood. My eyes clouded, and I found myself unable to hide my irritation. As such, I did not notice my fingertips relax and begin to draw slow patterns in the soft earth below.</p><p>Almost as if this was the way things were meant to be.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: The End<br>[<br>]</p><p>The bodies lay at my feet.</p><p>Their eyes lifeless. Waxy.</p><p>A blossom of brilliant crimson bloomed. Its wretched vermillion petals scattered. As I looked down at my palm and saw a dim reflection of glimmering light, memory finally returned.</p><p>I’d always wondered what was so different between the life I led within the walls and the lives of the children who lived outside it. But when I finally asked the question, it was far too late.</p><p>That was the moment I killed a part of myself.</p><p>My father gave me the mission and allowed me to choose my companions, so I selected my instructor and his younger brother. They had long been dissatisfied with our family and current lord, and since I would one day assume that position, I saw the mission as a chance to solve that most tired of problems.</p><p>Perhaps I let my guard down in the process.</p><p>I knew they schemed to use me to depose the current lord, and when I snuck into their manor under the curtain and shadows of night, the were so engaged in their plans they did not notice me. But as they continued to converse, I felt time growing short.</p><p>Father will be pleased that I am ridding him of traitors.</p><p>Alas, I did not bother think of<br>how<br> I would kill them. Soon, thick sprays of blood flew through the moonlight.</p><p>My father praised me when I returned with their heads. Though I took their lives in a cowardly ambush, he was pleased I had the backbone to kill people I knew personally. Thinking back, I’m sure it was a test—my father knew full well who the traitors were. Though I was now free from the trial, my life as a killer had only just begun.</p><p>Afterward, I meticulously washed the blood from my cold hands and let them rest, folded as though in prayer, on my lap. But it was a fool’s errand; those hands would be soaked in blood countless times after that. No matter how I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed, I could never cleanse the stains of murder.</p><p>I could never walk a different path.</p><p>And so, I began to plan.</p><p>I watch as the children devote themselves to their training. They have yet to learn of the outside world, and know nothing of the circumstances of their existence. I lead this family now, and much as my father before me, I will likely shake them free of their reverie with a trial of blood and death.</p><p>This is wrong. I know it to be so. But I have walked the path of a killer. Even if I were to cast it all aside and free them from this house, I know not if I could protect them from whatever the future holds.

She’s always alone, and always carries a katana, which tells me she must be of some significant standing. I’m not certain what she sees in my humble little establishment, but I appreciate the business.</p><p>At first, I was terrified of her, for the crest on her clothing belongs to the manor known as the Den of Demons. It’s an eerie place that normal citizens all steer clear of—but when I thought about it more, I realized the reputation came from nothing but hearsay. I felt shame at having judged someone based on rumors, and more ashamed still since she was a regular.</p><p>So today I made her more dangos than usual.</p><p>“This is my thanks for you being a frequent customer,” I say as I hand her two plates piled high with dangos.</p><p>She looks at me in shock and murmurs a brief thanks.</p><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Indigo<br>[<br>]</p><p>“I’m home!”</p><p>“Welcome back. …Hmm?

Crows caw softly in the gloaming. As I scan the quiet forest in search of any possible threat,<br> at my side murmurs, “It’s so peaceful here.”</p><p>He is here in search of a way to lead our country out of war. And as he travels from nation to nation preaching his message of peace, I walk at his side to protect him from those who refuse to listen. But I am a clockwork man created for war, and no matter how much time we spend together, the truth of his message continues to elude me. I draw close to the prince as he contemplates the setting sun. I wonder why he would think this place to be “peaceful.” Perhaps it has something to do with the red hues of dusk?</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>As the prince’s disease worsened, so did grow his impatience. It would seem he desires to achieve peace as quickly as possible. So when I suggest we rest in a church until he feels better, it takes a good deal of effort to get him to agree.</p><p>Today again, the prince’s condition is poor, so we wait for nightfall in the church. I take this opportunity to ask him: “What is a peaceful world?” He looks at me with surprise, but a willful flame burns in his eyes. After a moment, a thin smile crosses his lips. He reaches out, puts a hand on my chest, and says,</p><p>“It means you never have to hurt<br>.”</p><p>It must be a different sort of pain from wounds as I know them. He does not notice my lack of understanding and continues to talk. I simply nod my head, hoping it will bring him energy.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The disease spreads. The prince’s body withers and fades. When he can no longer stand, I travel alone to nearby villages in search of any food or medicine they can spare. In the villages, I see people driven mad by the horrors of war. The grieve for lost family. They curse their empty bellies. And they all turn their weapons on me—the clockwork man.</p><p>One day, I find a single apple in the woods. My prince lacks the strength to eat it on his own, so I chew small bites and feed it to him as a mother bird would its own young. As I see his haggard cheeks and hear his final, gasping breath… I feel a pain deep within my chest and finally realize the truth of everything that my prince has been fighting for.</p><p> he had said.</p><p>Oh, but why did it take such loss for me to finally understand?</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>One Hundred Years After Fleeing the Kingdom…</p><p>My bODy is RAvaGeD bY RuSt. mY meMOrIes GrOw DeFEcTIve.

A moment later, a cannon ball makes contact with a thundering crash and a portion of the tower collapses, raining debris everywhere.</p><p>“Estimating landing points and dispersion range. 5.34 seconds until falling debris impacts ground.”</p><p>At the base of the tower, a man performs rapid calculations, then takes ten quick paces back. When he stops, the debris strikes the very spot where he had stood just moments before, creating a billowing bloom of dust. But the man pays it no mind. Instead, he focuses on the enemy base that fired the cannon.</p><p>This battle unfolds in a technologically-advanced city of an enemy country. A city where smoke now rises from every corner. The king the man serves has a reputation as a tyrant, and has conquered many other nations through force of arms. This war was sparked when he severed diplomatic ties. And like many sparks, it has turned into a raging inferno. Whenever the man spies an enemy unit, he silently pulls his gun from the holster. One bullet. One kill. The enemy never knows what hits them. His is a supernatural, inhuman precision.</p><p>He is a mechanical soldier—a clockwork man without life—developed expressly for the purpose of fighting in war. The man dashes out across the battlefield, staying low. He has orders to scout out the enemy forces. It has long been assumed that both armies are of equal strength. But the enemy has developed a new weapon, one that can launch massive artillery shells over great distances. Their front line has been losing ground, and it is now only a matter of hours before the main base comes into range of the enemy’s guns. Having finished his scouting mission and dispatched what enemy soldiers he can find, the man returns to the base.</p><p>“Base” is a generous term—in truth it is little more than a large tent set up to temporarily house their commanders. Inside the tent, a map of the city is spread across a large table. Pawns have been placed on it to show the state of various units. The lead commander is a boy—one too young to even serve in battle.</p><p>“Your decision, Highness?”</p><p>The “Highness” spoken of is the boy: the kingdom’s eldest<br>prince<br>. It is he who sent the clockwork man on his scouting mission. And though the prince volunteered for this command, he now finds himself with the unenviable task of making decisions that hold sway over the fate of the entire war. Eventually, one of his generals suggests using some of their own men as a distraction in order to get the drop on the enemy. The prince frowns at this proposal before rejecting it. He is still clearly a boy in thought as well as appearance. He is unable to sacrifice any of his own men, even when it might lead to the survival of many times that number. It is naivety—and it is on clear display for all to see. The general who made the suggestion scoffs at this decision.</p><p>“Your hesitation will kill us all!” he cries.</p><p>He slams both hands on the table to better illustrate his point. Then he announces his intention to take his men and fight as he sees fit before storming out of the tent in disgust. Such division amongst the ranks only worsens the situation. Yet the prince continues to issue commands. It is unclear what so spurs him to action.</p><p>The clockwork man stands to one side of the tent and watches the prince from the corner of his eye. Though he says nothing, he knows the lack of leadership will eventually lead the enemy right to their door. And all too soon, this comes to pass.</p><p>“The base is lost, My Prince,” says the clockwork man.</p><p>“You must flee and save your own life.”</p><p>“No,” replies the prince.</p><p>“I’ll not leave while my men are still out there fighting and dying.”</p><p>Though the man calmly explains that the prince has no choice but retreat, his young charge does not seem to understand. There is a flash. A cannonball explodes into the tent, blowing it apart. All that remains is a massive crater and a few scraps of fabric. The man hears harsh breathing and turns his head. The young prince is running behind him. Just before the cannonball struck, he grabbed the prince and forcibly removed him from the tent. Now, the two of them run through an underground tunnel that leads outside the main part of the city. Behind them, the sounds of war gradually diminish.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Transient Light Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>War still raged in every corner of the city. This is why the clockwork man is leading the prince away. As he runs, he examines every corner for danger; looks in every shadow for possible ambush. The prince follows, gasping for breath. Eventually, the prince loses his footing and falls to the ground with a cry. The man stops. Part of his orders are to protect the prince. Though they gave him information on a need-to-know basis, he was told the prince suffers from a congenital disease. If he forced him to run further, it might cause serious harm.</p><p>The man quickly scans the area. The tunnel is massive, stretching on without end in both directions. The tracks that run under his feet speak to its use as a train tunnel during better times. After a brief search, he locates a door in the wall. It is half-buried in debris, but when the man peers inside, he finds a small storage room behind it. Slumbering within are battered lanterns, picks, and shovels. It is a storage place for tools used to maintain the tunnel. Thinking it the perfect spot to lie low, the man brings his young charge inside.</p><p>“This is all because I took command,” says the prince sadly.</p><p>With his ragged breaths now steadied, he is able to turn a critical eye upon his earlier actions.</p><p>As his kingdom commits to a cycle of endless war, soldiers and citizens alike are growing increasingly weary. The prince chose to take on the burden of command so he might be able to save them all. But in the end, things did not transpire as he wanted. He never considered having to place the lives of his own soldiers on the scales. But he now sees that what he thought of as kindness had instead brought death and pain to multitudes. The man stares at the boy and considers his words.</p><p>“You did well,” he says finally.</p><p>As the words leave his mouth, they feel strange. Off. He cannot grasp the intention behind what he said. It is simply the natural phrase he arrived at when he saw the prince’s grieved expression. The boy stares at the man blankly. They wait that way for a bit, alone in the darkness. But then, a small glimmer of brightness returns to his face. With an awkward, unpracticed smile, the boy thanks the man for saving his life during the recent battle.</p><p>“If I am ever in danger again,” he says, “maybe you can help me out.”</p><p>His words come with a hint of jest, but also a touch of joy.</p><p>The clockwork man continues his conversation with the prince, but as they do so, the boy’s coughs come more frequently. He eventually produces a medicine bottle from his pocket. The man surmises it is used to suppress the cough. But the bottle is empty. A pained look moves across the prince’s face, one that he tries and fails to hide.</p><p>“The royal family cannot show weakness around others,” he says.</p><p>“This is a lesson my father taught me again and again.”</p><p>He had not coughed once at the base because the medicine was able to disguise his symptoms.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“That is why what you see here must remain a secret.”</p><p>His speech complete, the boy raises a pinky finger and extends it to the clockwork man. The man’s database tells him this is a human ritual of promise. Though he intertwines his finger with the prince’s, the action makes him somehow uneasy.</p><p>The man suddenly hears the distant sound of footsteps. He concentrates his aural apparatus on the noise. Enemy soldiers, most likely. He estimates a dozen or so. He fixes his eyes on the gap in the door, half-buried in rubble. A thin, wavering line of light passes through it. He will never outrun the men with the sickly prince in tow. So both man and prince still their breaths, stay put, and wait. The man places his hand over the boy’s mouth so he will not give them away. The light through the door grows brighter, then brighter still.</p><p><em>cough</em></p><p>The prince’s body betrays them both.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Transient Light Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>They sit in the darkened room. The man presses a hand against the prince’s mouth, to still his breathing. Men—most likely enemy soldiers—are approaching their position. But as they wait for them to pass, the prince’s cough rips through the silence.</p><p>“Here!” yells a soldier.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The room surrounded, the man knows he has no choice but to destroy every last soldier in order to keep the prince safe. He kicks open the door and pulls his weapon from his holster. But he does not fire.</p><p>“Highness, you live!” says the general from before.</p><p>Sensing the turning tide of battle, he had taken his men and abandoned the base before seeking shelter in the tunnel. The prince is clearly relieved to see his rescuers arrive.</p><p>But as he approaches the soldiers, the general raises a hand and his men point their swords at him. The prince stops moving and confusion spreads across his face. This sight causes the general to snicker. He then explains a shocking truth: A plot has been unfolding behind the scenes. The prince is to be murdered, and his death blamed on the war. The plan was set in motion by his younger brother, who sought to eliminate his competition for the throne. During the previous battle, they had set their units in inferior positions in order to tilt the battle in favor of the enemy. After their position was overrun, they would use the ensuing chaos as cover to eliminate the prince. Once this was accomplished, the kingdom would send reinforcements to win back all the ground they had lost.</p><p>“This can’t be happening…” murmurs the prince.</p><p>The general grins wide.</p><p>Suddenly, the clockwork man turns to the general, who immediately barks an order:</p><p>“You there! Machine! Stand down at once!” The man is a mechanical soldier manufactured by the kingdom. He is programmed to follow any order from a superior officer. So at the general’s command, he freezes. He watches dispassionately as the general approaches the boy with his sword unsheathed. The prince does not yield ground, but instead stares blankly in the shock of his own country betraying him. But rather than strike the killing blow, the general takes the chance to berate his prey.</p><p>“You’re a useless worm—an unthinking coward who put all of us in danger in a sad attempt to earn your daddy’s approval.”</p><p>“I’ve lost men because of you. Good men. Friends.”</p><p>Tears begin to spill down the prince’s cheeks, but he does not deny the truth of these words.</p><p>His piece said, the general raises his sword above his head and prepares to strike.</p><p>The clockwork man cannot accept what he is seeing.</p><p>I must protect the prince.</p><p>I must stop the general.</p><p>I must reach for my gun.</p><p>But because of the general’s orders, he can do nothing. Instead, in the face of the prince’s last moments, he accesses records of the boy in his memory banks. He sees how the prince desperately issued commands in an attempt to keep his soldiers safe. He sees how the prince showed weakness—and trusted him. Suddenly, his records find a phrase the prince said moments before:</p><p>If I am ever in danger again…</p><p>The man draws iron, his hand fast as blue blazes, and blows the general’s sword arm from his body.</p><p>He fires again. And again. And again. The general’s men, caught off-guard, fall one after the other.</p><p>The prince had said the line in passing jest:<br>If I am ever in danger again, maybe you can help me out.</p><p>But the clockwork man chooses to take these words as royal orders that demanded absolute obedience—orders that override even those of a senior military officer. The wounded general snarls and draws his own weapon. The clockwork man shoots it out of his hand.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the tables have turned. The ground is painted red. The general begins to plead for his life, but it means nothing to the man, who presses his barrel against the general’s temple.</p><p>“Stop!” cries the prince.</p><p>Despite the general’s actions, the prince still seeks to save his life. Though he did not speak his feelings aloud, the man understands the reason behind the request, and so lowers his weapon. A moment later, more footsteps ring out. This time, it is not traitors, but the enemy army. The man has a choice: Save the general…or save the boy. He lifts the prince up and begins to run.</p><p>“I couldn’t save him,” says the prince as the general’s cries grow weaker.<br>“I tried, but I…I couldn’t…”</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Transient Light Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>In the middle of a wasteland where the wind blows dry stands a kingdom surrounded by walls.</p><p>The contours of an enormous castle waver as the sun sets behind it. The clockwork man and the prince approach the kingdom with a sigh. They are home. They stand before a thick metal door at the castle gate that leads to the town beyond. A guard sees the two and approaches.</p><p>“Y-Your Highness? Uh, I see you are safe…”</p><p>Everyone assumed the prince had met his end in battle, and the guards are unable to hide their shock.</p><p>The guards respectfully place the prince on a carriage headed for the castle. But as he watches the prince go, the clockwork man is presented with a false warrant for his alleged crimes.</p><p>The first charge: Abandoning his post.</p><p>The second charge: Betraying his unit.</p><p>The third charge: Murder of a superior officer.</p><p>The man did what he did to save the life of the prince. Though the accusations are willful mistruths at best, he has no way to combat them. And even if they were completely true, he still believes what he did was right.</p><p>The clockwork man is taken to a laboratory. A researcher orders him into a mechanical chair and places alloy fixtures on his limbs and torso. His “treatment” will be a complete memory wipe.</p><p>The man’s consciousness drifts in darkness. It is a strange sensation, almost like floating. This is his memory space. In the darkness, images begin to form. He sees men blasted to bits by his own steel. Memories of war. The face of every man he’s ever killed is recorded here. Next, he sees a conversation he had with the general. He is being ordered to protect the prince at all cost.</p><p>Images appear.</p><p>Images flicker.</p><p>Images disappear.</p><p>But finally, he comes to memories of the prince himself. He sees him desperately issuing orders at the base. He sees his pained expression as he spoke of his weakness. He sees him shed tears at hearing the truth behind the war.</p><p>“That is why what you see here must remain a secret.”</p><p>He sees the secret promise and ritual they shared. Compared to his other memories, these almost seem to…glow.</p><p>Suddenly, a sound—a single, insistent buzz. His memories of the prince begin to fade. He cannot stop it; they vanish one after the other. He should not be bothered by this. After all, he is a mechanical soldier designed for war. The memory-reset program whirs inside him. Though he should be accepting the procedure without pause, the man resists the deletion of any memories of the prince. He reaches out to them with his mind. But he will never find them. The deletion accelerates. The buzzing grows louder. A pained groan slips from his lips. What was the meaning behind his own feelings? Why did he resist the procedure?</p><p>The man’s eyes spring open. He does not know why he is in the laboratory. He knows only that he is a mechanical soldier created for war. One researcher looks at the results and shakes his head.</p><p>“Looks like there was an error in the reset process. You’re going to be discarded.”</p><p>After being informed of his fate, the man is taken away and placed in an underground storehouse. His only companion is the hiss of steam escaping from pipes. Mixed in among similarly discarded scraps of junk, the man attempts to sleep. But an alien sensation in his chest prevents it. Even after he searches all parts of his memory, he cannot locate the cause. He realizes that thinking about it will accomplish nothing. All he can do is wait as he slowly rots away.</p><p>There is someone I must see.</p><p>What comes to mind at the very end is nonsense.<br>But the man ignores it, and instead slowly closes his eyes.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: The First Trials<br>[<br>]</p><p>My wife is the queen of this land. She has long been a strong, kind woman, and the words she uses to describe our country’s future always shine brighter than the stars.</p><p>And yes, it is perhaps idealistic and naive for a ruler to speak of such things, but the more you listen to her, the more it sounds like an achievable reality. The beautiful country in her mind is precious to me, and I want to see the notion become real. But more than that, I want to be at her side on the day she achieves it, because the hours she spent telling me of her ideal future have been some of the finest of my life.</p><p>But I know. I know that in order to achieve her dream, we will  have to, at times, resort to methods she hates. Physical force. Violence. …Or worse.</p><p>A King’s Memoir, Part 1</p><p>Our kingdom had always been adept at creating intricate clockwork mechanisms, with a skill in the art far surpassing that of any neighboring lands. As such, the other countries on the continent considered us to be a great menace.</p><p>And perhaps they were correct to do so, for a new type of research was taking place within our kingdom—one that would secure us an endless supply of soldiers. Throwing all of our money, power, and effort into the task, our country soon found favorable results, and the soldiers were brought to life more quickly than even the most optimistic projections.</p><p>Our new creation was the ultimate soldier: a creature made of steel and wire that would never tire, and with a mind capable of calculating at impossibly fast speeds. The lead researcher, who called his creation “clockwork people,” explained that having passed basic performance tests, they would now enter the final stage of testing before sending them into the field.</p><p>“I appreciate you taking the time to come out all this way, Your Majesty,” said the lead researcher as he gestured to a line of clockwork people on the other side of the window.</p><p>They looked more human than the last time I came to observe the work. And yet, despite their familiar bodies, their eyes were empty⁠; they seemed less like they were standing of their own free will and more that they could do nothing else.</p><p>“We have come to the conclusion,” continued the researcher, “that in order for clockwork people to operate in an optimal manner, we must integrate into their thought processes four laws. And today, I would like to demonstrate for you a test of these laws.”</p><p>The researcher’s fingers flew over the device in his hand. A moment later, the room went dark, and an image was projected onto the wall. It was a bit difficult to make out, but through the shadows and gloom I could see a mass of people heading into a village. Some were the clockwork people, but a number were our own human soldiers—I even recognized a few of their number.</p><p>“This is a live feed of a unit presently en route to the stronghold of some bandits,” said the researcher. He went on to explain that the test was for the clockwork people to protect the senior officer leading the arrest operation.</p><p>The bandit stronghold looked like any other house in the city. But when the unit marched in—their footsteps rough and heavy in the moonless dark—they caught the bandits off-guard and captured them without incident. It was an impressive display, one so good I failed to hide my glee.</p><p>“I see Your Majesty is pleased,” said the researcher. “And yet, we’ve something far more impressive in store.”</p><p>As the squad led the captive bandits out of the building, a few more of the ruffians launched a surprise attack. Chaos engulfed the scene⁠, and I saw the superior officer at the front of the fray take a stray bullet and fall. The clockwork people immediately surrounded him, prioritizing his safety above all else.</p><p>But then I noticed someone strange: one of the clockwork people did not leapt to the officer’s defense. Instead, it hurried to the side of a random human soldier and assumed a protective stance.</p><p>After a bit of a struggle, our unit managed to subdue the bandits, and the video cut out. But all I could think about was the clockwork soldier who had protected the random man—and when I mentioned this to the researcher, I saw a smile appear on his face.</p><p>“You’ve a keen eye, Your Majesty. In truth, we had the commanding officer switch uniforms with that man.”</p><p>“Interesting,” I replied. “I’d heard the clockwork people automatically confirmed rank by the insignia on a uniform. That alone would be impressive, but this one somehow saw past the insignia and recognized the superior officer.”</p><p>“Your Majesty is indeed correct.”</p><p>“But how?”</p><p>The researcher explained that the clockwork person in question had been collecting information of its own accord during the mission. It did not rely solely on the intelligence provided before the mission; instead, it continued to observe and arrived at the correct conclusion through a constant updating and verification of information.</p><p>“To sum up,” said the researcher, “we have given the clockwork people small variations to their cogitation. In essence, each one has something of a personality.”</p><p>“And it appears this ‘personality’ worked in our favor this time,” I added.</p><p>“Indeed, sire. Yet while we have achieved fruitful results, we will make certain not to incorporate any dangerous behaviors to said personalities.”</p><p>As I nodded, another thought occurred to me. “What were you testing in this particular instance, by the way?”</p><p>“The First Law: A clockwork being must always protect the lives of the royal family or its own commanding officer.”</p><p>He turned to me then and bowed his head slightly, “Now then, Your Majesty, do you have any opinions as to what should be done with this particular unit?”</p><p>“Keep testing it,” I said as I turned to leave. “We can always dispose of the thing later if we need to.”</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: The Second Trials<br>[<br>]</p><p>My wife is pregnant. It will be our first child, and the future ruler of this country.</p><p>Her breathing is pained. Her skin, which once shone like a newly-polished pearl, it is now pale and lifeless. As I stand before her and gaze upon her distended stomach, I cannot contain my anxiety.</p><p>She has always been sickly, and I worry she may not survive the birth. It is the first time I realize I have such a weakness, yet somehow I manage to swallow my fear and smile at her.</p><p>“Let’s think of a name for our child,” she says to me in a faint whisper. “We will entrust our baby with the future of this country, so I want to name it together.”</p><p>I grasp her delicate, fragile hand, and nod.</p><p>A King’s Memoir: Part 2</p><p>There came the deafening sound of something large splitting open, followed by a wave of high-pitched, delicate noises. Several clockwork soldiers had obeyed orders and opened fire on a vase of flowers.</p><p>The kingdom was currently pushing the development of automatons of war. Yet if they were to be the ideal soldiers, we would need to implement in them four distinct laws. The destruction of the flower vase was a test of the second law, one many members of the royal court had watched with great interest.</p><p>The Second Law: A clockwork being must follow the orders of the royal family or its highest ranking officer.</p><p>Several soldiers—as well as a common beggar plucked off the street—were shouting commands at the clockwork people. The test was to see if they could pick out the voice of the highest-ranking person and execute that command.</p><p>The clockwork people stood in a line on the other side of thick, reinforced glass. All wore special earpieces; we were told that was how they heard the cacophony of orders. And when they determined the highest-ranking one—to fire on the flower vase—they did so without hesitation.</p><p>As the test continued, they fired on a number of different items from among a jumbled mass on a desk.</p><p>“Let’s have them shoot the clock next,” said the lead researcher. A moment later, the orders came through both the headsets of the clockwork people and speakers in the room where the royal court was stationed.</p><p>“The pot!” cried the beggar.</p><p>“The vase,” murmured the soldiers.</p><p>“The clock,” whispered the commanding officer.</p><p>The clock exploded in a hail of bullets, causing the audience to cheer with delight. After clearing up the mess, the researchers came out of a back room with a number of live rabbits and proceeded to dump them on the ground, where they began hopping about.</p><p>“Might you order them to kill the rabbits, sire?” said the lead researcher.</p><p>The voices began anew, order spilling upon order. But when my voice rang out, it was followed by the predictable thunder of gunshots. But something was strange this time: unlike the previous demonstrations, the gunshots were not in unison. Indeed, while all the rabbits now laid dead on the floor, some had been shot multiple times.</p><p>What could explain this discrepancy? Yes, the rabbits were moving about, but I had been assured the clockwork people had near-perfect accuracy.</p><p>The head researcher clearly sensed my question, “One of the units feels joy when it kills a living being, sire,” he said. “Another is hesitant, while a third makes no distinction between animate and inanimate objects. Basically, the results change depending on their personalities.”</p><p>Ah, yes. The personalities. When I last visited the lab, the researcher informed me that each unit had been given small changes to their cogitation, resulting in what they were terming “personalities.”</p><p>After cleaning away the gore, the scientists brought out a group of monkeys. The head researcher then proceeded to dole out various conflicting orders.</p><p>Bite their ears.</p><p>Soothe them.</p><p>Grab their legs.</p><p>While the clockwork people obeyed, their actions were not anywhere near in unison. And when they were given the final order to kill the monkeys, things diverged even more. Some took their time, enjoying the act of slowly taking a life. Others, however, seemed wracked with guilt, and their hesitation to end a life ended up causing the poor creatures far more suffering than if they had simply been swift and sure with the killing blow. So though the means had been different, the pain experienced by each monkey was ultimately the same.</p><p>I personally found it fascinating. But the expressions of my fellow royals soon clouded over; they clearly had not expected to see such a gruesome sight. The lead researcher, however, paid no attention to their discomfort, and ordered his subordinates to proceed to the final test.</p><p>One held with humans.</p><p>Just as with the monkeys, the lead researcher gave the clockwork people various orders. But this time, their personalities shone through brighter than ever. When they acted against their targets—with their unique hairstyles, face shapes, and clothes—they moved with a grace and skill that belied their mechanical nature. But in the moments where they were<br>not<br> exerting power, their movements were awkward and comical.</p><p>I suddenly understood that was how deadly weapons were meant to be. But I also realized that nothing more could be gained by dragging such a thing out further.</p><p>“Enough,” I said. “End this test.”</p><p>The lead researcher turned to the clockwork people.</p><p>“Kill them,” he said.</p><p>Hearing the order, the crackle of gunfire rang out through the room. One unit, however, did not act. Instead, it simply stood in place, almost as it had been powered off. This was a unit which had obeyed every previous order with a kind of dull, plodding precision—one which I thought might lack a personality altogether.</p><p>As I shook my head in disappointment at having witnessed our first failure, I heard the sound of a sob and looked over to see a small boy crying.</p><p>“Ah, most excellent,” said the lead researcher.</p><p>I turned to him, confused, and he continued.</p><p>“I believe the unit was following a voice not from its earpiece, but from this very room.”</p><p>The crying boy was the heir to one of the country’s most prestigious noble families—and upon hearing his distress, the clockwork soldier had stayed his hand.</p><p>Now that was<br>most<br> impressive.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: The Third Trials<br>[<br>]</p><p>At the end of a difficult birth, we finally have a healthy baby boy. And yet, my wife’s condition continues to worsen, almost as if the child is stealing her life away.</p><p>But she is too clever to leave things in flux, so before becoming bedridden, she bequeathed the throne to me—leaving the future of our country in my hands.</p><p>Now that I hold the power of a king, I see everything differently, and I realize doing things my wife’s way will make it difficult to bring wealth to our land.

Doing things my way? Down one path, we link arms and work in harmony with other countries. Down another, we expand out borders with force. So though we wish for what appears to be the same future, why must the journey be so different?</p><p>A King’s Memoir, Part 3</p><p>The kingdom’s best scientists and most advanced technologies came together during the development of the clockwork people. And as the tests continued—tests to see if they could endure real-world usage—things reached a new and exciting phase.</p><p>The lead researcher had concluded that four laws needed to be incorporated into the clockwork people’s thought processes if they were to operate optimally.</p><p>The First Law: A clockwork being must always protect the lives of the royal family or of its own commanding officer.</p><p>The Second Law: A clockwork being must follow the orders of the royal family or of its highest ranking officer.</p><p>The Third Law: A clockwork being must protect itself, as long as doing so does not contradict the first two laws.</p><p>Now, the team was finally ready to test both the durability of the clockwork bodies, as well as the Third Law.</p><p>Thirty clockwork people stood in neat rows in the testing area. Each one had a slight variances in their thought process, a trait that would manifest as a kind of “personality.” While this was done in order to produce more accurate reports, it meant each clockwork person would act differently in response to the same order.</p><p>“Let us begin,” said the lead researcher.</p><p>A large door at the far end of the room rolled back to reveal one of our largest weapons—a thing the size of an elephant that stomped into the room on multiple legs.</p><p>“This unit has proven to be one of our greatest battlefield successes,” said the lead researcher proudly. I knew all about it, of course: it was a crude device that couldn’t execute fine maneuvers, but was perfect for situations requiring overwhelming destructive power. It was also the first weapon I’d ordered to be built after ascending the throne.</p><p>“In this test, we hope to see the clockwork people defeat their foe while protecting themselves in the process. Any units that accomplish this task will be considered our first field-ready clockwork people.”</p><p>As a buzzer sounded, signaling the beginning of the test, the clockwork people sprang to life before the massive weapon could even respond. They pelted it with gunfire from every direction, but that did little more than scratch its heavy armor plating. After a few seconds of this, they changed course and began focusing their attacks on its joints in an effort to bring it down. But then the weapon unleashed a brilliant beam of white-hot light from its cannons, and attack that sent the clockwork people flying.</p><p>“It’s like watching ants fight a scorpion,” I mused.</p><p>“Precisely,” he lead researcher enthused. “But wait.”</p><p>The different personalities of the clockwork people quickly began to emerge. A handful attempted to escape, but were gunned down before they could reach the doors. Some clung desperately to the massive weapon, while others ran in chaotic circles and fired their guns wildly. The weapon kicked and smashed and stamped them in a frenzy, and it seemed only a matter of time before all the clockwork people would be destroyed.</p><p>There was a clear imbalance of power, and I felt certain the test had entered its final, messiest stage. Irritated, I turned to look at the leader researcher, and was shocked to see him smiling.</p><p>“Please watch, Your Majesty!”</p><p>At his prompting, I saw one clockwork person firing at the weapon from behind cover. As I watched, I realized it was not firing indiscriminately, but instead targeting one specific part of its armor.</p><p>After creating a rather sizeable dent, the unit leapt out from its hiding spot, ducking and weaving through cannon attacks as it approached the weapon. Once there, it reached into the dent and ripped the plating free. Clinging to the weapon itself means there’s no possibility of being struck by any of its attacks. The weapon’s pilot, realizing their predicament, causes the weapon to move in such a way that the clockwork person would be shaken free, but it quickly leapt back on and peeled away more of the plating.</p><p>“There is potential here,” murmured the researcher.</p><p>The newly armored clockwork person—the last one standing—ripped off another chunk to reveal the weapon’s internal circuitry. If it could break through in that precise spot and tear apart the wiring, there was a chance of victory.</p><p>But the unit was in a sad state. Despite the armor, it had been thrown to the ground countless times, losing an arm and suffering various other injuries. Before it could reach into the wires, it was thrown free into a pile of its disabled fellows. And as it struggled to pull itself to its feet, the massive weapon stomped over, raised a single leg, and ended the test for good.</p><p>“A disappointing ending,” I said, shaking my head.</p><p>Having completed its mission, the weapon sat quietly in place, as though awaiting its next orders. The valiant unit that had fought to the end was now buried amidst the husks of its fellow clockwork people, and I could no longer pick it out from among the rest.</p><p>“However,” I added, “that one unit showed promise.”</p><p>The lead researcher nodded in excited agreement.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: A Weapon’s Completion<br>[<br>]</p><p>My wife—our queen—has died.</p><p>Her past, including everything she said and did, now feels as fiction. My light is gone. My world is empty. Hollow.</p><p>I was right: love and kindness are not enough to save us. Only by military force can this country and its people hope to be governed.</p><p>Though I was the one who ordered the development of the clockwork people to begin in earnest, the first prince still looks upon our new soldiers with fear. Though he’s grown into a kind young man—one fitting of the name his mother gave him—I feel he may be too weak to take up a position of power.</p><p>If only the prince had been named not by my late wife, but by me. If we had only named him after our god of war as I desired…then perhaps things would have been different.</p><p>A King’s Memoir, Part 4</p><p>Metal bodies that do not know exhaustion.</p><p>Mechanical brains which calculate at impossible speeds.</p><p>This<br> is the new face of the soldier.</p><p>As our research progressed, tests were carried out in the name of the kingdom’s prosperity. We had been calling our new creations “clockwork people” under the assumption they would take on tasks in place of humans. But one day, the lead researcher said something that changed everything:</p><p>“Your Majesty, I would like you to meet our very first clockwork soldier—the first one to successfully pass all of the tests.”</p><p>Before me knelt a clockwork person—no, a clockwork<br>soldier.<br> Its head was bowed in the manner of a loyal retainer, and I was immediately intrigued; while I had seen many such machines at work in the tests, only a select few had managed to catch my eye.</p><p>“This unit does not seem familiar to me,” I mused. “Which tests did it pass?”</p><p>“Indeed, Your Majesty,” replied the lead researcher eagerly. “This is not a unit you have seen in action. Yet at the same time, one could also say you<br>have.<br>“</p><p>As I frowned, the lead researcher pointed out the window toward the massive testing area, where clockwork corpses were scattered across the floor like discarded toys.</p><p>“This unit is the cumulative result of all our tests, physically as well as mentally.”</p><p>The perfect soldier would have a quick mind, a tenacious body, and an unshakeable spirit. And while humans could come close to these ideals, they could never quite achieve them to the utmost. But now, the lead researcher was claiming this new creation has done so.</p><p>I gazed down at the kneeling clockwork soldier, who remained perfectly still. From all of those clockwork people—all of those sacrifices—this unit had been born.</p><p>“It was not simply a matter of switching out parts, though,” the researcher continued. “We extracted experiences and thought processes from the remaining records in order to optimize this unit’s operational circuits.”</p><p>Images of all the units that had acted in bizarre fashions—the ones that left an impression in past tests—flashed through my mind. “Such a combination would certainly make a clockwork soldier that fights like a human. But I thought I made it clear that was not our ultimate goal.”</p><p>What I wanted were beings that did not think, but instead followed orders, doing whatever was necessary to see a task to completion.</p><p>“As you said, Majesty. Our tests proved the greatest results are obtained from units with the weakest personalities.”</p><p>The lead researcher had once thought instilling human-like emotional variations would lead to the creation of soldiers that could adapt to any environment. It was not an altogether incorrect thought; several of the clockwork people I saw throughout the tests managed to put such personalities to good use. But the clockwork soldiers were weapons—and standardized, practical tools did not require variations.</p><p>“But this is not to say their personalities were a total waste,” continued the researcher. “Their thoughts and experiences played a role in heightening the abilities of the unit before you. Of course, we will ensure it does not manifest as a personality, but as a kind of auxiliary mechanism that helps the unit execute its mission.”</p><p>The researcher wound his way carefully through his words, making them sound less like an explanation and more like an excuse. But I merely nodded, choosing not to question him further. Because even if a personality<br>were<br> to manifest, all we had to do was delete it.</p><p>“And the fourth law?”</p><p>“Expunged, Your Majesty.”</p><p>The researcher originally wanted a fourth law: A clockwork being must serve the royal family and its superior officers of its own will. But weapons did not need a will any more than they needed personalities. All they needed to do was take lives without thinking. And now that this unit had been born, we could unleash our weapons to the world.</p><p>“Raise your head.”</p><p>The clockwork soldier looked up at me as I spoke. Though it was designed to look human, its expression was completely blank, which caused me to smile.<br>This<br> was the face of a killing machine—a heartless creation that would carry out any order without a second thought.</p><p>I crouched before the unit, took its chin between my fingers, and peered into its glassy eyes. “As our country’s first clockwork soldier, I think you are deserving of a name.”</p><p>I smiled as I fell silent. Though I appeared to be deep in thought, I already had a name in mind.</p><p>“You will fight like a god of war and bring victory to this country. Therefore, your name will be…”</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Machine’s Will<br>[<br>]</p><p>This man is a clockwork soldier built by a kingdom consumed in never-ending war.

The kingdom razed my home, killed my sister, and took everything from me. But its lust for power fed an unsustainable hunger for war, and it eventually collapsed. Still, scattered remnants of its forces remain. And I won’t stop until every last one of them is dead.</p><p>I tarry for a while in a small village. Under the midday sun, I hear a voice call for help. I see a kingdom soldier raise a fist and bring it down on the head of a woman. He moves to deliver a second blow. I leap in the way and take it myself before swiftly ending his life. The woman begins thanking me profusely… But I ignore her. I fight for revenge—not to save lives or spread justice. As I move to leave, the woman bars my path. Asking to see my prosthetic arm, she draws in close. She examines it carefully, looking it up and down. It was damaged when I took the blow the soldier intended for her. Though I try to explain that I can repair my arm, she waves me off with a dismissive grunt.</p><p>“We’ve a skilled engineer in the village,” she says. “Come along.”<br>Before I can think to protest further, she takes my hand in hers and leads me off.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I am guided to an engineer so that my arm might be repaired. The engineer is indeed skilled, but lacks the needed parts for repairs—and unfortunately, it will be some time before they’re available. Still determined to show her thanks, the woman huffs loudly, grabs my good arm, and drags me off anew.</p><p>We end up in the village pub. She gathers the drinkers around her and spins an epic tale of how I saved her from the kingdom brigand. Soon, I find myself regaled with food, drink, and song from all corners. I take a bite of something and nearly swoon; I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed a hot meal. When the woman leans in and asks how it tastes, I feel an unfamiliar smile slowly make its way across my lips.</p><p>How long has it been since I smiled? Weeks? Years? More?</p><p>I thought I’d lost the ability to do such a thing long ago.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Eventually, the parts arrive and my arm is finally repaired. The woman asks me how it feels, and I’m both surprised and delighted that it seems to move more smoothly than before. As I test it out, the engineer smiles at me and says,</p><p>“Consider this my way of saying thanks for saving my wife.”</p><p>It turns out the engineer and the woman are married. She turns red as he talks about everything he loves about her. I can only chuckle and show a wry smile as I listen. Finally, she can take no more attention and leads me out of the shop. As we walk, she tells me they have been married almost three years. She also thanks me again for my actions from before. This time, I manage to face the woman and thank her for the assistance. I tell her my work in the village is done and I will be on my way…… But that’s not the entire truth. I’m also afraid of what might happen if I grow used to the warmth and kindness of others. The villagers all gather at the edge of town to see me off.</p><p>“Come and see us again real soon!” says the woman.<br>As I walk away, the last thing I see is her small hand happily waving goodbye.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>It wasn’t long after leaving the village that I heard the news: A soldier was attacking the village in revenge. Before I even know it, I am on my feet and running like the very wind itself.</p><p>I find the village in flames. The soldier is roaming about madly as he scours the village in search of every last person he can find.</p><p>“That man was family!” he cries as he puts another house to the torch.</p><p>“All of you will pay for his death with your lives!”</p><p>My vision is fire.</p><p>Before I even have the chance to feel my building rage, I engage the man in battle. My arm works even better than before. In a moment, I cut him down like a dog.</p><p>When the deed is done, I walk around the village in search of survivors. In the very last house, I find the woman and the engineer with their arms wrapped around each other and their bodies still. I thought I had saved them—saved<br> of them—from a terrible fate that first night… But my actions had only been the impetus for an even greater tragedy. These innocent people had been caught in the cycle of revenge, and now their lifeless eyes stare accusingly up at me.</p><p>And you know what? They’re right.<br> did this. It is all because of<br>. As I fight, I only add more links to the chain of revenge—but if I stop, the remaining soldiers will continue to commit their horrid atrocities. So I have to fight. I have no choice. But in so doing, will I, too, become an object of hatred in this world of neverending slaughter? All that lays before my eyes is a crimson world of blood and fire.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Promise Sworn Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>When she was yet young</p><p>A blazing inferno reflects in a pair of eyes. The girl’s empty expression betrays nothing. The sight of flames roaring in the darkness is etched upon her mind. Her heart speaks to her in a dry tone.<br>You will never forget this night. Not for the rest of your life.</p><p>“Mom, come help with this!” The girl’s bright voice rings through the kitchen. Lined across the table are a colorful array of vegetables in hues of green, yellow, and red, as well as a large piece of meat. Cradling the girl’s younger sister, her mother turns to the sound of her older child’s pleas.</p><p>“Well, someone’s enthusiastic about their cooking.”</p><p>The mother looks on as the girl continues bustling about the kitchen. She is learning to cook from her mother.</p><p>“You need to add a little more seasoning, honey.”</p><p>“Here, try it now.”</p><p>The moment the girl brings the food to her mouth, her furrowed brow loosens and a smile breaks out.</p><p>“Oh, yummy!”</p><p>The two chefs look at each other proudly, content in the knowledge the recipe is perfect. The girl sets the steaming dishes down. The mother plops the little sister in her chair as the three of them gather around the table.</p><p>The wood practically groans under the weight of the food, which is far too much for even three hungry mouths. As the mother starts cutting meat into small pieces for her youngest daughter, she looks at the elder with a wry smile.</p><p>“It’s good you got more practice in, but we clearly went overboard on our portion control.”</p><p>Everyone chuckles as they dive into their meal.</p><p>“Dad’s coming home soon, right?” asks the girl as she happily bounces up and down in her chair.</p><p>The letter had arrived a few days ago. It was a notice their father would soon be returning from his military service. The moment the girl read it, she rain into her mother’s room and announced her grand plan:</p><p>“I’m going to make Dad’s favorite dinner when he gets back!”</p><p>She has been awaiting his return for so long. The last time she saw him was the morning he left for the front. His expression betrayed mixed feelings, and the young girl had no way of knowing what sort of emotions they were. But as he held her tight, he leaned into her ear and whispered,</p><p>“I will come back to you. I promise.”</p><p>That promise was everything to her—and now it is coming true. When she thinks of it, she can hardly contain herself. Feelings she managed to keep suppressed all this time are now bubbling up like water from an overfilled pot. But she manages to hold them back and keep her calm.</p><p>I’m the older sister now<br>, she thinks. </p><p>I have to hold it together.<br> Her younger sister was born after her father left, and word of her birth had not been able to reach him on the battlefield.</p><p>What will Dad think when he sees her? Will he love her like me? …Will he love her more than me?</p><p>The girl shakes her head to clear the ugly thought away.</p><p>…………</p><p>……</p><p>As she rubs her swollen belly, she marvels at how well the cooking lessons have gone—aside from her ability to judge proper quantities, of course. She leans back in her chair and indulges in a brief flight of fancy. All of her father’s favorite foods are lined across the table. As he takes the first bite, a satisfied smile crosses his face. She sits at his side, no longer the young child he once knew, but not yet a woman grown.<br>He’ll be amazed to see how much I’ve changed. It’s going to make him so happy.<br> Her reverie is interrupted by the voice of her mother: “When you’re done woolgathering, you can help clean up.”</p><p>The girl starts, nearly tipping her chair over in the process.</p><p>“You’re the older sister now; you can’t afford to be lazy.”</p><p>The girl pouts a little at the scolding, but her mother pays this small rebellion no mind. Instead, she entrusts her to take care of the dishes and heads off to attend to her sister.</p><p>It must be so hard for mom to take care of both of us alone.</p><p>I need to work as hard as I can to support her. She’s always put on a smile for us, no matter what. And that’s why I’ve been able to keep going, even when I was sad or lonely or depressed. I’m too old to be having jealous fits or slinging snide remarks. So what if she doesn’t pay much attention to me anymore?</p><p>She nods to herself as she reaches this conclusion, and proceeds to wash and put away the kitchenware.</p><p>When night comes, the exhausted girl begins falling asleep the moment her head strikes the pillow. As she drifts off, she feels her mother’s hand on her head.</p><p>“Thank you, honey. You are<br>always<br> appreciated.”<br>With that, her mother stands and leaves the room. In her dreams, her entire family sits happily around the table.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Promise Sworn Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The girl stares out the window. Whenever she hears a noise coming from the door, she bolts to her feet. Her mother makes a comment about her being worse than a puppy, which causes her cheeks to go pouty once more. With each ring of the doorbell, the girl rushes to the door, only to return each time filled with disappointment. Finally, the moment she was waiting for arrives. The front door opens to reveal her father in his military uniform. How long had they waited for this? How long had they<br>all<br> waited for this? Unable to help herself, the girl leaps up and runs to her father.</p><p>But then… Something shocking happens. Her father shoves her aside. She crashes to the ground, unable to process what just happened. A silence ill befitting a family reunion falls over them. Sensing the heavy atmosphere, the youngest begins to cry. The father covers his ears at the sound of her wails and rushes off to his room.</p><p>“Don’t worry girls,” says her mother as she helps her daughter up. </p><p>“Your father is just tired.”</p><p>She smiles as she says this, but the expression does not carry over to her eyes. The girl remains stunned. She can’t fathom what just happened. Her sister’s sobs echo around the entryway. She does not see her father again until dinner. She is almost beside herself with worry; what if her actions had caused her father’s mood? As she bites her lower lip, her mother comes up behind her.</p><p>“It’s okay, honey. You didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p>Rather than comfort her, the words make tears spring to her eyes. But she manages to hold them back and force a smile on her face.</p><p>It will be better once he eats. He’s going to love it.</p><p>This is what you’ve been working so hard for, remember?</p><p>Thus determined, she begins helping her mother with the meal. The fragrance of grilling meat covered in her mother’s secret seasoning soon wafts through the kitchen. A knife falls up and down on the cutting board. As the ingredients take on new forms, the girl’s heart leaps wildly between anticipation and anxiousness. They put up the decorations they’d prepared around the room and pile the plates high with steaming warm food in order to celebrate the day. And then, they await the guest of honor.</p><p>Some time later, he enters the room and takes his seat. The whole family is finally together again. But her father doesn’t touch his food. Instead, he just…sits there. The daughter looks at him out of the corner of her eye, noticing for the first time how gaunt he has become; how pale and sickly he appears. Her dream has become reality, but there is no joy in it. She begins to wish it weren’t real after all, that she might wake up from it… As that thought crosses her mind…</p><p>A crash rings out. She is yanked back to reality by the sound of shattering porcelain. The carefully prepared dinner is now scattered across the floor.</p><p>“BUGS!” screams her father, his voice raw with terror.</p><p>“Oh god, they’re EVERYWHERE!”</p><p>Her panicked father leaps up and dances away from the table. He then begins stomping the food into the floor with the heels of his heavy military boots. He is trying to squish the insects: the ones only he can see. Her little sister begins to wail again. Even her normally composed mother stared on, dumbfounded. She can’t even pretend to understand what is happening. A few seconds later, her father comes to his senses.</p><p>“I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…”</p><p>He lets his words trail off as he sways unsteadily on his feet. Then he bends down and begins to slowly scrape the food off the floor, moving as if in a trance.</p><p>“Dad, no! Let me do it!”</p><p>The girl drops to her knees and begins a frantic cleaning. Her mother rushes to grab some rags, and for a brief, insane moment, it almost feel like everything will be okay. But then…</p><p>“Ow! Dangit…”<br>In her rush, the girl had cut her finger on a broken shard of plate, and now drops of blood spill down to the floor. The moment her father sees it, he turns to the side and vomits. When her mother returns, she finds a room filled with horrid smells, shrieking cries, and chaos. Her father stumbles from the house and into the night without even bothering to clean himself. He does not return until the next day.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Promise Sworn Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Her father is unable to find work. Days pass. Then weeks. Nothing changes. With their savings all but depleted, the mother is forced to find work outside the home. The job of watching over the younger sister falls to the elder. But youth has a way of forgetting trouble, and the little sister is constantly happy, vibrant, and full of life. Each time she begs her sister to play, it brings a bit of warmth to her tense heart. But there is also much pain as well.</p><p>One day, she and her sister are playing with blocks. They build a small town with a strong gate and a mighty castle, and populate it with the little sister’s toy soldiers. The girl takes out a small instrument and begins playing a jaunty march as her sister moves the soldiers to and fro. This game—which they call “Parade”—has been the little sister’s favorite of late. Suddenly, her father wanders by the room, his face clouded. The moment he sees the soldiers, he begins to scream:</p><p>“No! NO! Stop that RIGHT NOW!”</p><p>The girls freeze. He tears the soldiers out of the little sister’s hands, rips their heads from their bodies, and kicks over the blocks. The girl stares wordlessly. Her sister begins to cry. Her father throws the ruined toys in the trash and backs out of the room with a terrified look on his face. He is a different person now. She no longer knows him. And yet, he is still her father, whom she loves.</p><p>He’s just sick<br>, she tells herself day after day.</p><p>He’ll get better. Things will go back to how they were.</p><p>Their father does seem to feel guilty about his condition. One day, he offers to help with the housework. Mother and daughter both agree instantly, hoping that perhaps this smallest of steps will be the push he needs to get well.</p><p>The next day, he begins preparing a bath for the little sister. The girl is worried by her father’s slow, clumsy movements, and finds herself checking in on him every few minutes. But watching him draw the bath just feels so very<br>normal<br>, and for a brief moment, she finds happiness in the scene. Expecting things to be ready soon, the girl peeks in and finds her father about to place her sister into the bath. Her little sister is staring at the bath, eyes wide. Sensing something amiss, the girl looks at the water and sees that it is boiling. She runs to her sister and quickly scoops her up.</p><p>“Dad, no! What are you DOING!?” Her father stares at her, confused.</p><p>“I was just…putting her in the bath…”</p><p>Her father’s answer contains no acknowledgement of the situation’s horror. She fumbles out a lame excuse about her not being ready for a bath and flees the room with her sister in her arms. She is glad her father wants to be involved with the family. She truly is. But his actions bring no joy. Mother and daughter find themselves more exhausted with each passing day.</p><p>And one night…it all comes crashing down. Her patience gone, the girl’s mother begins to scream at her husband. Her furious cries penetrate the bedroom walls. The girl has never heard her scream like this before. Within moments, her father begins to bellow back, and the sounds of their rage fill the air. Suddenly, the girl feels a strange sensation, almost like her heart is splitting in two.<br>What’s going to happen to us?<br> She does not know.

But the heat will not let her.</p><p>…!</p><p>Dad…</p><p>Mom…</p><p>My sister!</p><p>A moment later, she dashes out of her bedroom.</p><p>“Dad!”</p><p>Her father is standing in the living room. Flames lick up around him. Her mother’s body lies still at his feet. Her father slowly turns to look at her. His eyes are two empty pools. His mind is gone. The girl stares at him, unable to act. The flames grow stronger. A vibration shakes the room. Something falls. Glass shatters. Finally, the girl snaps back to reality. She is standing in the middle of an inferno.</p><p>Suddenly, her vision goes black. She smells a familiar, comforting aroma, and realizes she is wrapped in her father’s coat. He lifts her in his arms and sprints out of the house. When he sets her on the ground and unrolls the coat, her eyes are burned by the intensity of the flames. Her consciousness a whirl, she manages to croak out:</p><p>“M-my sister…”</p><p>She does not know if he hears her or not, but he turns around and runs back into the house. His silhouette is swallowed by fire.</p><p>Time passes. A minute is an age. The girl can only stare and hope. Finally, a figure emerges from the inferno. Her sister is in his arms, wrapped in a blanket. He reaches the girl and collapses to the ground; the smoking blanket unfurls to reveal her sobbing sister. The girl runs her hands over her sister to check for injuries, and is shocked to find she has none. But her father is a different story. His skin is peeled and blackened. His remaining hair crumbles to ash when she touches it. His clouded, bloody eyes stare unseeingly at nothing. After a moment, his mouth begins to move. He repeats the same words over and over. It is an apology. But it is not meant for her—nor for her sister or their mother. Instead, he is apologizing for actions during the war, his mind lost amidst fields of battles long-since fought. His voice grows softer and weaker. In an increasingly faint voice, he calls his daughter’s name. However, she is unable to make out whatever words follow. By the time she attempts a reply, he is gone.</p><p>………………</p><p>…………</p><p>……</p><p>Some time later, she learns portions of what happened to him during the war. The orders he was given. Young children clutching weapons. Blood. Gore. Screams of pain. Eyes staring up from the dirt. The eyes of little girls. Girls much like his own daughter. Her father left the battlefield, but his spirit never did.</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>Why why why why why</p><p>No matter how many times she asks… No one ever answers her. Perhaps there is no answer—or at least, no answer that can roll the stone off her heart. The two girls stare at the smoking remains of their home.</p><p>“Sis? Where’s Mom? Where’s Dad?”</p><p>Her little sister looks up at her quizzically. They are now alone in the world. The girl smiles gently at her sister. Like her own question, hers has no answer. Yet she feels a resolve begin to build.</p><p>I will make her happy. Whatever it takes. She will never have to feel the way I do right now.</p><p>She squeezes her sister’s hand as she makes this silent vow.<br>A vow that is now her entire reason for living.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Pessimism Blues<br>[<br>]</p><p>Glasses clink. Men guffaw. The saloon is filled with chatter, and lively as always. As I attempt to finish my drink in peace, a man who’s so drunk he can barely hold up his head suddenly takes notice of me.</p><p>“Hey! Hey, she’s here! It’s the one-armed woman!”</p><p>At his words, the doors fling wide and spill forth a group of familiar men.<br>Oh joy,<br> I think.<br>The collectors are back.</p><p>“Hey there, sweet thing! We haven’t got your payment this week. Maybe we’ll just take one of your legs instead.”</p><p>The lively saloon suddenly becomes silent, as if someone threw a damp blanket over the rowdy denizens. “Sorry,” I say, my words slurred. “I’ll pay at the end of the week.”</p><p>The collectors scoff. “And how’s the great kingdom-hunter gonna do that, huh? You know that horror show you call a body ain’t no good for manual labor.”</p><p>The kingdom.<br> They were the ones who put my home to the torch and turned my sister into a killing machine before deciding she was a failure and cutting her down. Twenty years ago that was, and I’d spent the long years in between killing every last soldier I could find. I’d been good at my job—maybe even too good, because these days I don’t find anyone who claims to have been part of that army.</p><p>You think I’d be happy to have done such a thorough job, but I don’t feel happiness anymore. I also don’t feel satisfaction, or excitement, or joy. All I feel is an emptiness so deep it threatens to consume me every time I open my eyes in the morning. The only thing that drives me now is this saloon and the mind-numbing cure that awaits inside. If I have money, I drink. If I don’t, I work. If I can’t find work, I use my left arm as collateral and borrow—the same left arm that once cut through so many soldiers of the former kingdom.</p><p>“Try speakin’ up for once!” growls one of the collectors as he grabs me by the collar and lifts me off my feet. The sudden movement causes the drink I was raising to my mouth to reverse course and splatter all over his arm—a development he doesn’t exactly take in stride.</p><p>“Damn fool! I’ll kill you!”</p><p>He throws me aside, grabs a short metal rod from his belt, and begins slamming it into my side. I drop to the floor and curl into a ball as he keeps raining blows down upon me. If I had my left arm—and my wits—I could handle this wretch with ease. But in my current state, I’m a miserably weak and powerless thing.</p><p>“Please… I’ll…pay back…”</p><p>I’m begging now, which some dark corner of my mind finds amusing. Despite my hollow days being filled with nothing but drink and self-loathing, I’m somehow still afraid to die. Life really is a comedy.</p><p>“That’s enough.”</p><p>The words come from a man in a cloak who is standing in the doorway. The setting sun behind him makes it impossible to see his face, but his voice stirs something deep in my chest.</p><p>“Mind your business,” spits my assailant. “This ain’t got nothing to do with—“</p><p>The cloaked man is a blur. One moment he’s standing in the doorway, and the next he’s holding a knife against the collector’s throat.</p><p>“I said, that’s enough.”</p><p>The collector’s breath catches in fear. Unwilling to push the issue further, he lowers his weapon and slinks out of the saloon with his metaphorical tail tucked.</p><p>“You good?” asks my rescuer. He extends a hand down to help me up, and recognition suddenly floods over me. I know this man—and this is the second time he has saved my life.</p><p>The first time we met was the night my sister and I became orphans. We were so cold and tired and so,<br>so<br> afraid, but he extended his hand to us and asked the same simple question: “You good?” From that day on, he taught me everything I needed to survive, from preparing game for eating to wheedling things from adults.</p><p>“Been looking for you,” he says.</p><p>Me? He’s been looking for me? Why the hell would he do that? I’m a drunk, a useless lump with nothing to live for but lacks the guts to die. And yet, apparently my mentor decided I meant enough to track across all the miles and all the years.</p><p>“Why?” I manage to say.</p><p>“Got a request. Hear me out?”</p><p>At that moment, I realize this is my last chance. If I let it go—if I tell him no and turn back to the bottle—I won’t last another week.</p><p>“Sure,” I finally reply. “Let’s hear it. And…thanks.”</p><p>It’s a lousy reply, but the best I can do at the moment. And as I say it, I feel a tiny little something in my soul: A spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, my life is going to change for the better.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: A Criminal’s Gloom<br>[<br>]</p><p>I reconnect with the man who saved my life once before.</p><p>He’d heard rumors about a woman with prosthetic limbs and sought me out for an important mission: to rescue his beloved, who had been kidnapped by a pack of former kingdom soldiers. Playing mercenary is part and parcel for me these days, but hearing I missed some soldiers makes my blood boil, so I’m happy to take the job for a whole number of reasons.</p><p>“Hang on,” I say to the man as we walk. “I know this road.”</p><p>“‘Course you do. Bastards took up residence in our old home.”</p><p>The reality of this hits me like a cannonball. I remember these trees—how my sister and I used to run through them without a care. I haven’t been here in at least 20 years; maybe that’s why the soldiers decided to hole up here.</p><p>“How’s the new arm?”</p><p>I know he’s changing the subject to lighten the mood, so I go ahead and play along. “Better than the last time I pawned it. Broker did a good job fixing it up.”</p><p>The man bought my arm back as payment for my taking the job. And now that it’s a part of me again, the old bloodlust that came with it has returned as well. But as I turn it this way and that, my companion suddenly looks over at a nearby thicket.</p><p>“Come on out,” he says in a voice casual as a spring day.</p><p>Sensing an enemy, I raise my sword above my head and grit my teeth. This time, every last whisper of the kingdom will perish. This time, all of them will fall. This time—</p><p>“GYaHAhahAHAHahaHA!”</p><p>What leaps out at me is another modified human soldier with prosthetic limbs—someone just like me.</p><p>“It’S BIg siS! EVEryONe, cOOoooOoMe!!”</p><p>On this signal, prosthetic soldiers swarm like insects. I feel a gorge rising in my throat as they approach. My sword wavers. But it isn’t fear that does this. Oh no. Fear would be easy.</p><p>All of them look exactly like my little sister.</p><p>The creatures don’t share my hesitation, and the first one who reaches me kicks my leg out from under me, sending me crashing to the ground.</p><p>“WheEhhEEE hEeEE HEEeE! ThiS Is FUn! THIs feeLS GOOd!”</p><p>She leaps on top of me and makes to plunge her sword into my chest, but I manage to knock her aside. As she tumbles, a small picture locket snaps away from her neck and sails into the sky.</p><p>She was once a girl. A normal girl with a normal life.</p><p>“Come on!” yells the man as he pulls me to my feet. “RUN!”</p><p>We race into the forest, speeding through the trees I once loved so much. When the giggling of the soldiers finally fades, we lean against a pair of tall oaks and try to catch our breath.</p><p>“Lost ‘em,” says the man as he places a comforting hand on my shoulder. At his touch, I realize my entire body is trembling. I can tell he thinks it’s because they looked like my sister, but he’s wrong. That’s not the reason I’m trembling at all.</p><p>I’m just happy they’re still alive.</p><p>After losing my little sister, I lived only to destroy the kingdom—and the day I thought that mission was over, my life lost all meaning. Yet because I wasn’t strong enough to choose death, my life took on a weird sort of limbo, one where I woke up, drank myself into oblivion, then repeated the process all over again. But now? Facing the kingdom again after so very long? I feel…excited. My anger toward the kingdom is what kept me alive all these long years, my life bound to the object of my loathing.</p><p>And I hate myself for it.</p><p>“Hey,” says the man. “I know you think you can only live for revenge, but don’t think that. It’s too sad. Hell, I’m sure the life you’re looking for is out there somewhere.”</p><p>His kind voice is a gentle warmth on my scars, and my small hand fits inside his gnarled one as if it was meant to be there. “I’ll help you when this is over, all right? We’ll find a new way of life. Together.”</p><p>When was the last time I felt such warmth?</p><p>I want to tell him now—tell him<br>everything<br>. Because the walls I’ve spent so long constructing around my heart have finally begun to fall.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Warped Echoes<br>[<br>]</p><p>Having accepted my one-time benefactor’s request, I accompanied him to my hometown—a place where former kingdom soldiers were said to be hiding. Though I had twinges of doubt in my heart, I ignored them so I might bring his wish to life:</p><p>I want to save my beloved, who was kidnapped by men from what remains of the kingdom.</p><p>We snuck toward town, deftly avoiding the soldiers who patrolled the area. But once inside, I could hardly believe my eyes. The town was brightly decorated as if for a festival—and amidst the glitter and pomp, augmented soldiers went about their regular lives.</p><p>“WhAT aN AusPICIouS DaY!</p><p>WHat AN auSPIcioUS daY!”</p><p>Perhaps it’s fairer to say they were<br>trying<br> to live regular lives. Some were giving morning greetings. Some were cleaning. Some were eating. But their every movement was stiff and unnatural, like old toys in need of repair.</p><p>“The hell is going on here?”</p><p>I did not mean to speak the words aloud, but the sight so shocked me that they simply slipped out. The moment my breath became sound, the augmented soldiers turned as one to look at me.</p><p>“KIlL! KIlL! I wAnT to KiLL!”</p><p>They swarmed like insects, and I barely managed to protect my companion from the initial assault. “We’re getting out of here NOW!” I cried, shoving him back. I didn’t want to lose anyone important to me ever again—I<br>couldn’t<br>. But then an electric shock coursed through my whole body, sending me crashing to the ground.</p><p>“Seize her, but do not harm her.”</p><p>Just before my world faded to black, I realized the person giving the orders was the very same man I had been trying to protect.</p><hr><p>“Ah, good. You’re awake.”</p><p>The man’s voice pulled me from my unnatural sleep. I tried to move and couldn’t, and quickly realized one of the soldiers was holding me in place.</p><p>“Are my toys not adorable? Ah, I tried to get them to act human, but it didn’t work out quite as I planned.”</p><p>His expression was bright, his voice as gentle as ever. It only made the experience all the more uncanny.</p><p>“Why!?” I cried. “Why are you working with the kingdom!?”</p><p>“Oh, there’s no need to worry about<br>that<br>,” he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. “The kingdom is gone—consigned to the dustbin of history. All I did was borrow a bit of their technology regarding human augmentation.”</p><p>He pulled out a locket and opened it, staring spellbound at the photo inside. “Do you recall my wife?” he murmured, almost to himself.</p><p>Memories of a more peaceful time flooded over me. Though older than me, his wife was a tiny waif of a thing who resembled a little girl more than a woman grown.</p><p>“We ran when the kingdom attacked, but our journey only led to a different kind of hell.”</p><p>He stopped his story, pulled a newspaper clipping from his pocket, and tossed it at my feet. The headline read: ROYAL MILITARY EXPANSION CAUSES CHEMICAL POLLUTION.</p><p>“The rot started in her lungs before spreading to the rest of her body. It was fast—<br>so<br> fast. Like a wind. The doctors had no idea how to help her, but rather than surrendering hope, I decided to replace her failing body with that of a machine.”</p><p>“You wanted to augment your own<br>wife<br>!?”</p><p>“Yes. And if you wish to know how it ended, you need only remember the thing that jumped you in the forest.”</p><p>At that moment, I realized the face in his locket was the same as the soldier I encountered in the woods. Even though the kingdom itself was gone, its horrid technology lived on to birth new pain—and those who weren’t compatible with augmentation inevitably lost all control of themselves.</p><p>“Ah, yes,” he said in response to the horror that moved across my face. “I fear she’s been like that ever since the operation. I needed to know if there was a way to get her back, so I kidnapped people and experimented on them to further my research.”</p><p>The soldiers I had seen in the forest? The people I’d seen in the town? All victims of his cruel work.</p><p>“Alas, I could never get the results I wanted. But then I found<br>you<br>.”</p><p>Me—someone who survived the operation. Even though I was deemed a failure, I still retained a sense of self.</p><p>“I wanted you to see the pain of those who do not have the sweet release of death. With you helping me, I can<br>end<br> that! My research will grow by leaps and bounds!” A flame lit in his eyes then, one stoked by madness. “You endured the augmentation, so give me your mind! Give me your body! Do so for the sake of my wife, as well as for all who suffer in agony and pain!”</p><p>He had come down a road from which he could not turn back, all for the sake of one he loved. It was a truth I knew painfully well. </p><p>Which is why I could not permit him to continue.</p><p>I shook off the soldier holding me and readied myself for battle. This nightmare would end today.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Final Brilliance<br>[<br>]</p><p>The man who once saved me had modified human bodies at the cost of countless lives.</p><p>“AAaaAAHh Ha HA hA ha HA!</p><p>LEt’S dANce, sIs!”</p><p>I didn’t want to hurt the augmented soldiers more than he already had, so instead I damaged their machine parts, rendering them inoperable.</p><p>“Animal! You would destroy the fruits of my research!?”</p><p>Realizing the tide had turned, he tried to slip away through crowds of augmented soldiers. But I saw right through his ruse and chased him down.</p><p>“The kingdom’s technology dies with you.” I said as I stood over him, sword at the ready.</p><p>“No, wait! This is good for you, I swear! I’m going to help you find a new way of life, just as I promised!”</p><p>I could tell he was trying to curry favor, but instead of rage, the attempt created only a kind of emptiness inside me.</p><p>“You think having me aid your experiments is a new life?”</p><p>“Yes! You can<br>help<br> people! You can finally be a savior, not a murderer!”</p><p>Oh, but he knew how to spin a pretty tale. Yet I was viscerally aware of how his technology brought about only misfortune and misery.</p><p>“I bet she would be happy if you helped!” he continued frantically. “Your sister―”</p><p>He spoke my sister’s name.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The tip of my blade shuddered.</p><p>I saw a distant past, then. Beheld forgotten memories—memories of the only time in my life that could hope to soothe me. And he destroyed them. He used my sister’s name for his own ends.</p><p>“All I want is to perfect the technology!”</p><p>As my memory fell apart, I destroyed him.</p><p>“That’s a shame.”</p><p>There was a flash as my blade struck flesh. Silence descended over the area. It was over quickly—far too quickly.</p><p>Enough is enough.</p><p>I had my revenge, and lost my life’s meaning in the process. I know now that my days would run into each other one after the next, turning into a meaningless, insubstantial blur I could never escape.</p><p>“Time to join her.”</p><p>The ending of my own life would snuff out any lingering existence of the kingdom. I brought the blade to my chest, felt the pressure. But the moment I began to push, a soft thud from somewhere beyond the trees brought me to a halt. If there were augmented soldiers left, I had a duty to dispatch them quickly and painlessly. But as I approached the sound…</p><p>“Who are you?” asked a little girl who could be no more than 10. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Me? I, uh… What are<br>you<br> doing here?”</p><p>“I live here with Papa and—<br>cough, cough<br>!” The hand to her mouth turned pale red. “Sorry. I can’t stop coughing. Mama was like that too.”</p><p>“What happened to your mom?” I asked.</p><p>Her eyes clouded. “Mama…stopped being Mama. But Papa’s trying to fix her.”</p><p>“Is he now?”</p><p>“Yes! And once Mama’s fixed, he’s gonna fix me, too!”</p><p>The man had expressed his wish to save his beloved. That, at least, had not been a lie.</p><p>“But Papa’s been so busy with research that he…forgot me.”</p><p>It all started with a wish to save his wife, all well as his daughter. It started with a desire to keep his family safe. What did he say in the end?</p><p>I want to perfect the technology.</p><p>The poor fool was so caught up in the journey that he forgot the destination.</p><p>“Have you seen my papa?”</p><p>There was only one thing to do. I can’t say it was the correct thing, or that I even had the right to do it in the first place. But…</p><p>“Your papa went on a journey. He’s trying to find a way to save you. You can stay with me until he comes back.”</p><p>I must be at her side.</p><p>“Aw! I wanted to wave bye.”</p><p>The girl took my hand with her own. It was soft and warm as the sun.</p><p>“He didn’t want to see you sad,” I whispered.</p><p>“Papa’s so nice,” she said with a smile. As she did, I felt the evening breeze slowly push aside whatever remained of my hesitation.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Half a Hunter’s Life<br>[<br>]</p><p>“All right, let’s leave our review there for today.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Good idea.”</p><p>“When’s the next one?”</p><p>“Not a problem.”</p><p>“Um, if I may?”</p><p>“Yes?

This forest air can’t be good for clockwork bodies like yours.”</p><p>“All is in good order, My Prince. Do not trouble yourself.”</p><p>I know he only says this because he worries about my illness. I stop our progress for a moment and turn to him.</p><p>“And what if a fight finds us? We should check to be sure.”<br>He nods slowly before taking a seat. Then he powers down, causing the eyes behind his bandages to go dark.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>It’s so much easier to start a war than stop one. Once the fighting starts, violence leads to distrust, creating a vicious circle where peace seems impossible. This is why we are currently traveling from country to country: To create a third power which might mediate negotiations and find a way to lead us out of this bloody war. But my status and bloodline mean there are many who wish me ill. Thankfully, my companion has saved my life time and again. He is a clockwork man, and there is little I can offer him. The best I can do is assist in his maintenance.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>I feel a tightness in my chest. My body grows heavy. Sweat slicks my hair against my head. It’s clear my illness plans to claim me one way or the other. Stifling a cough, I retrieve a bottle from an inner pocket. I snap off the seal and drink it down. It is the last of the medicine that holds my illness at bay. Once it wears off, I will know how bad my condition truly is. My breathing steadies. It is but a temporary reprieve, but it will do. Maintenance is almost finished.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>I return the empty bottle to the same pocket I took it from and wait for my guardian to wake up. He won’t worry now—at least for a while. The medicine will see to that. I can’t afford to show him my true pain. And besides, it’s not like I’m going to get better. Suddenly, my companion wakes with a whirr.</p><p>“I’m operating well,” he says.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Glad to hear it,” I reply softly.</p><p>“Let’s keep going.”</p><p>“Yes, My Prince.”</p><p>We have no time to waste and no time to stop. That is why I decided to continue with the lie. It’s the right thing to do—I know it is.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Flame Sparks Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Before the king abandoned his son</p><p>Gray eyes scan the page.</p><p>“A king is not a conqueror.”</p><p>“A king is the symbol of a nation.”</p><p>“A king is the representative of his people.”</p><p>Row upon row of words about how a king should be. Yet the eyes in which these words are reflected showed no hint of admiration or discovery. The boy exhales in tedium; these things are already known to him. As a prince, he has been striving to develop all manner of wisdom in order that he might prepare for his future as a king.</p><p>“All these books say the same things.”</p><p>Annoyed, the prince closes the book and makes to return to his quarters.</p><p>When he reaches the exit, he notices that the guards all seem a bit more on-edge than normal.<br>Ah, yes,<br> he thinks.<br>The signing ceremony.<br> Today, his father was signing a trade agreement with a neighboring country, supplying them with clockwork soldiers in exchange for large amounts of their natural resources. The neighboring kingdom desired these clockwork soldiers greatly, for they were of small population and thus lacked in troops. But clockwork men who would fight eternally without grumble or pause were a breakthrough solution to this particular problem. And as for the prince’s kingdom, they needed natural resources to further their own research and development, much of which was dedicated to these very same clockwork soldiers.</p><p>His footsteps echo across the marble floor. The castle is large, and it is quite a distance to his chambers. He thinks about the ceremony as he greets another set of guards. Though he is a prince, he has yet to witness such an international affair for himself.</p><p>It would be good for me to know about such things.</p><p>Maybe I should take a quick peek and see what it’s like.</p><p>It can only benefit me in the future, after all.</p><p>Thus having rationalized it, he decides to walk past the drawing room where the ceremony is being held on the way back to his chambers.</p><p>The group from the neighboring country has already arrived, and there is quite a large crowd gathered. There are numerous guards from the prince’s kingdom, as well has ones from the opposing side. There are ministers and clerks and advisors and lawyers, and in the center of it all, the two kings. But then, at the edge of the crowd, the prince spies a young girl. She lifts the hem of her white skirt and curtseys at the room, seemingly at ease amidst all the murmuring adults. After gazing at her for a bit, realization finally dawns.</p><p>She’s the daughter of the other king—a princess.</p><p>He recalled what he just been reading in his book.</p><p>She is not a king herself, but she seems to understand how a royal family member should act.</p><p>As he stares, the prince reflects on his own position.<br>Will I ever be that confident? That composed?</p><p>As if sensing his attention, the princess suddenly turns around. He immediately hides his face behind the book in his hand, but it is a useless gesture. Before he knows it, the princess is approaching him. He tries to pull himself together and fails miserably, but the princess either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care. Instead, she stands right in front of him and says:</p><p>“You seem pretty weak for a prince.”</p><p>“Whaaa?” he responds. The prince immediately rejects his earlier thoughts.</p><p>She’s not acting like royalty at all—she’s just RUDE.</p><p>“Y-you’re the daughter of the king!” he stammers.</p><p>“You should be ashamed to treat a fellow royal in such a way!”</p><p>He thinks his argument came out rather well, all in all, but it is a wasted effort. The princess is wholly uninterested in what he has to say.</p><p>“Right, whatever. Listen…”</p><p>“<br>Whatever<br>!? What do you—“</p><p>The girl suddenly places a finger on his mouth, cutting off his argument. Her lips, which are the color of early spring blossoms, break into a smile as she says: “Want to go play?”<br>His gray eyes widen in bewilderment.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Flame Sparks Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A bead of sweat drips down the prince’s white hair and down his ashen face.</p><p>“A-all right. But if we get in trouble, don’t blame me.”</p><p>The pair dodges their way through a web of security. Though the princess wanted to leave the castle entirely, the guards at the entrances were far too numerous—so they would have to content themselves with the castle courtyard.</p><p>“You see?” she says.</p><p>“Everything is fine. I’m a perfect angel when we’re on official business.”</p><p>Her eyes glow with an inner flame as she surreptitiously watches the guards, causing him to think she must be his complete opposite. And yet, he cannot deny the truth of her words. Tales of her flawless decorum had reached his ears as well. However, such tales often took the form of comments implying she was strangely unhuman—almost like a perfect doll. This is why the prince considered the meaning behind her attitude. Even if all of her famous good conduct was merely an act to impress foreign powers, why was she not acting like that now?</p><p>“That guard is such a nuisance. We need to get by him to get through here.” she growls.</p><p>“Well? What do YOU think we should do? You live here, after all.”</p><p>But the prince does not respond; he is staring down at his pocket watch, lost in thought. The princess grabs his wrist and pulls him close.</p><p>“Hey! Are you even LISTENING to me!?”</p><p>“Gya!” he cries.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to… Um…”</p><p>The prince trails off; now it is his counterpart’s turn to be lost in thought.</p><p>“Oh,” she says, as another smile slowly emerges on her face.</p><p>“What a pretty watch…”</p><p>“There’s a banquet tonight, right?”</p><p>Her tone is high-pitched and playful, but there is a touch of something else creeping in around the edges.<br>She must mean the formal dinner after the signing ceremony.<br> Before he can respond, she continues:</p><p>“In that case, the castle will be heavily guarded all night. Which means<br>that<br> soldier must have a shift change coming up.”</p><p>Suddenly, the prince understands what she is driving at. But just because he understands, it doesn’t mean he likes it.</p><p>“He’s going to be anxious for his relief to come, which means he’s going to be staring at his watch.”</p><p>“And… you want to slip by while he’s distracted?”</p><p>The princess winks, clearly pleased that he’s finally caught up.</p><p>“Y-yeah, but it doesn’t matter if he’s looking at his watch, because he’ll hear us when we run past him.”</p><p>“Then we just have to run<br>quietly<br>. Right?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>The princess turns away as he speaks, her mind already made up. As he trails off, she watches the soldier and waits for her moment.<br>There’s no reasoning with this girl. Words and logic are meaningless.</p><p>Suddenly, the princess tenses. The guard takes one hand off an automatic rifle and brings his wrist to his face. A yawn breaks out. Then another. It happens in a moment—not even ten seconds in all. But it is all the princess needs; she grabs her reluctant new friend by the scruff of his neck and makes a break for it. The two race down the corridor and out of the guard’s sight. The prince, feeling yanked in all directions, only prays his feet won’t betray him with a fall.</p><p>“Yesss!” cries the delighted princess as they come to the door that leads to the courtyard. The prince tries to slow his ragged breathing as the princess reaches for the handle…</p><p>And suddenly stops.</p><p>“What the hell?<br>Seriously<br>!?”</p><p>Windows line the courtyard, each with a guard behind it. Though they will be able to enter the outdoor area, they’ll have to move carefully to stay out of sight.</p><p>“Dammit! We can’t play like this!”</p><p>“Shhh! You’re too loud!”</p><p>In the end, they sit down in the shade of a shrub and use its leaves to stay out of sight. The rays of the midday sun cast their shadows on the grass, but it seems unlikely such a thing will be noticed. The princess mutters in discontent as she looks up at an opening in the courtyard roof.</p><p>“Well, this has been an extraordinary waste of effort.”</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Flame Sparks Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The princess reaches down and plucks a handful of grass from the perfectly manicured green lawn. She stays silent, and the prince is too winded from their run to the courtyard to strike up a conversation. Perhaps out of pity for his weakened physical state, the princess seems willing to set aside her desires for play.</p><p>“Hey, so…” begins the prince.</p><p>“What did you want to do, anyway?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, that.”</p><p>She places her hand on her forehead in a clear display of thinking—or perhaps she is only<br>pretending<br> to think—and responds with a sigh.</p><p>“I don’t know. I didn’t plan that far ahead.”</p><p>“So this was all a spur of the moment thing?”</p><p>“Yeah. I mean, I figured we’d come up with something.”</p><p>The prince laughs dryly.</p><p>I’m a sad, scrawny introvert who treasures careful thought, and she is a lighthearted dynamo who shoots from the hip. We couldn’t be more different.</p><p>Though the prince was worried their conversation would be stilted, it quickly proves to be anything but.</p><p>“You know, there’s stuff you can’t learn from books.”</p><p>“True. There are some things you cannot know without experiencing them yourself.”</p><p>“Oh, so you<br>do<br> know that! How delightful.”</p><p>“It has been especially true today.”</p><p>“Hee hee! And what does that mean, hmmm?”</p><p>The prince smiles with her.</p><p>“You are a rather strange princess.”</p><p>“And you are a very odd prince.”</p><p>Above them, a bird with black tail feathers chirps merrily away. The princess peers at the prince.</p><p>“So talk to me. You’ve studied lots of subjects, right?”</p><p>“I suppose?”</p><p>“Well, what kind of king do you want to be? What kind of country do you want to build?”</p><p>She stares at him, waiting for a response.</p><p>“Well, you have to promise not to laugh, but…”</p><p>He holds the book in front of his face again, as if to ward off her inevitable scorn.</p><p>“I want to make this a country without war.”</p><p>“There are many people in this world, and it is filled with so many wonderful things…”</p><p>“But I believe all of us working together could create even more wonderful things.”</p><p>“If everyone was working toward the same goals, no one would be harmed at the expense of another.”</p><p>“Anyway, um… That’s my wish.”</p><p>“So what about you?”</p><p>“Me? Hmmm…”</p><p>Before she can respond, a shrill ring interrupts them. It’s coming from the prince’s pocket.</p><p>“Sorry,” he says with a bow.</p><p>“It’s my father.”</p><p>The princess shrugs.</p><p>“Eh, don’t worry about it.”</p><p>He apologizes again before leaving their shady spot and bringing the communicator up to his ear.</p><p>The voice on the other end is most familiar.</p><p>“Where are you? What are you doing?”</p><p>“F-Father, I was just…”</p><p>The prince’s expression stiffens as his voice turns hoarse. He had tricked his own guards to reach an off-limits courtyard. He was cavorting about with the princess of a neighboring country. The truth would only lead to trouble. But his father was not a man who could be led astray with lies.</p><p>There’s no choice. You have to tell him.</p><p>You have to take responsibility for your actions.</p><p>“I am in the courtyard, Father.”</p><p>“Are you alone?”</p><p>His father’s tone is unemotional: a simple request for information. And that terrifies the prince.</p><p>“…No. The princess is here.”</p><p>As he squeezes out his answer, he doesn’t notice his new friend’s worried gaze from across the yard.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Father and son fall quiet—but the weight of that silence could not have been more different for the two.</p><p>He is furious with me. Punishment will be swift.<br> But the next thing he hears defies all expectations:</p><p>“Very well,”</p><p>The king pauses a moment.</p><p>“I’ll be there soon. The two of you stay put.”</p><p>The call ends as quickly as it began. When he returns, the princess peers at him worriedly.</p><p>“You okay there?”</p><p>“Er, yes,” he replies nervously. “Everything is fine.”</p><p>“So, um, what were we talking about again?”</p><p>His words couldn’t have sounded more hollow to his ear. But the princess makes no more mention of it.<br>“Oh, that? I dunno. I’ve totally forgotten.”</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Flame Sparks Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>“Hey, so…why did you invite me to play?”</p><p>This question has been on the prince’s mind. But his true concern is about the call from his father. Something about the instruction to stay put gnawed at him. Perhaps because he expected his father would be angry with him; regardless, he can’t help but feel something ominous about it. Across from him, the princess squirms.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>“Well, see…”</p><p>Unlike her rapid-fire banter from earlier, she seemed to be choosing her words carefully.</p><p>“I think you probably feel the same way, but my circumstances are sort of…unique.”</p><p>She stares off into space as she talks, looking at nothing.</p><p>“My parents are always too busy for me—all the adults are.”</p><p>“The only other kid I ever see is the one in the mirror.”</p><p>“Maybe it would be different if I wasn’t an only child, but…”</p><p>“It’s just that, I’ve always felt like I had to act a certain way around other people, you know?”</p><p>Once she says that, she turns back to look at the prince. And he looks at her in return.</p><p>“That’s why I thought maybe I could find someone who—“</p><p>Her sentence would never be finished. It has been blotted out. He feels the shadow of his father. Smells the aroma of gunpowder. And stares at a white dress quickly turning red. It is too late to stop it. Military boots thunder around him. Her spring-blossom lips are as lush as ever. And he understands that his father’s men have shot the princess.</p><p>…He wishes he didn’t.</p><p>“Well done, my son.”</p><p>A low voice rumbles in his ears.</p><p>The soldiers lower their guns at the king’s approach. His face twists in a bitter scowl as he speaks.</p><p>“What a disgusting nation.”</p><p>“To think they would use a young girl in such a way. To think they would scheme to kidnap my own son!”</p><p>The prince sits absolutely still. Not a breath stirs.</p><p>“We shall have no agreements with such a country.”</p><p>The prince finds it hard to believe she could have had such plans. But he doesn’t have definite proof, and his father’s shadow now looms over his heart, chiding him.</p><p>“What could you possibly know about someone you’ve just met?” it seems to say.</p><p>“I could not leave this matter unattended,” continues the king.</p><p>“Dangerous buds must be quickly plucked.”</p><p>He turns to his men as if seeking agreement. The soldiers all nod heartily. At the sight, the prince feels both relief and a disturbing fear that seems to crawl across his body.</p><p>“Come, Rion. We must be off.”</p><p>Turning to leave, the king calls out to him.</p><p>“Y-yes, Father.”</p><p>He responds firmly, as if to push aside his jumbled thoughts. It was his father, the king of this country, who had spoken, which means it must be true.</p><p>You heard the stories. She was “strangely unhuman,” remember?</p><p>As he follows his father, clutching his book to his chest, he does all he can to convince himself.</p><p>The blood splashed across the cover drips onto his sleeves.</p><p>The next morning…</p><p>Clad in ceremonial dress, the prince stands before his people. His clothes speak his station to all the world. By wearing them, he plays a role as his country’s symbol. His legs quake as he stands on the platform. His father has given him a single order: “Tell the people of the fear you experienced.”</p><p>She had never scared him. Yet he has no choice but to say it. His own assassination has just been foiled…which is the perfect justification for war. His mouth, dry as a desert, struggles to form words.</p><p>“……”</p><p>He does not know what he is going to say. Perhaps she was an assassin. Perhaps she was innocent.<br>He does not know. But there is one thing he does know: His words will spark a war. With a shaking voice, he begins to tell his tale. A chill alights on his fingertips before spreading across his body. But he balls his hand into a fist and fights to ignore it.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>An Ashen Tomorrow, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>The hush of night falls over the castle.</p><p>Unsteady footsteps and scraping metal echo through marble corridors.</p><p>A pallid face.

Then a voice from behind me, sudden. I begin to turn around, hoping to find the source, when it dawns on me:</p><p>Oh. Right. I’m dreaming.</p><p>My mother had departed the world when I was young, but at this moment, she’s talking to me. Looking at me with her soft, kind eyes.</p><p>That’s right. We read it together.</p><p>Why did it take me so long to realize this was a dream?</p><p>At the end of this book, humans kill the wolf in an attempt to protect the children. The same creatures who abandoned their own offspring in the woods hunt down and kill the beast that attempts to care for them. They hold the children at bay as they reach for her, and sing praises for justice as they slaughter the passive animal.</p><p>This part always bothered me when I was young. I’d been unable to accept it, and remember asking my mother why the wolf didn’t fight back when she had been in the right. “I suppose that’s just how mothers are,” she replied after a moment of thought. I didn’t understand back then—in fact, her response made me angry. But when my mother saw my reaction, she only smiled.</p><p>I have been dreaming.</p><p>I have been dreaming of memories long past.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Eye and Steel<br>[<br>]</p><p>I am dreaming.</p><p>I am dreaming of the day my mother and my younger self were reading a book together, and my heart quivers as I see her for the first time in many, many years.</p><p>No, that’s not true. I kept her picture with me—the old news clipping that reported the queen’s death.</p><p>When I was exiled, I had no time to gather photographs or keepsakes—there was time only to run. But I happened across the clipping while making my escape and snatched it up, and it has never left my side since.</p><p>The woman in the photograph, however, is not the mother I knew so well. I do not see her gentle smile or her kind eyes—I see only the regality of a queen. Yet even knowing this—and knowing I am in a dream—I desire to speak with her above all else. But despite my fervent wish, my mother’s face shifts like smoke in the dusk, and the closer I tried to study her, the hazier her visage becomes.</p><p>The next thing I know, I am standing in a different place: a hallway filled with the acrid tang of metal and cordite.</p><p>There is something strange about the way I am viewing the world, and after a moment I realize my eye level is different than it had been. I am taller now, viewing a memory of a different time.</p><p>I look around and take in my surroundings. Before me stands a great window filled with massive panes of glass; beyond are row upon row of guns belonging to the clockwork soldiers. They resemble human arms, and the way they are spaced equally apart disturbs me in a way I cannot easily explain.</p><p>Beside me, another figure observes the laboratory. It is none other than my father—the king of our country.</p><p>Ah. I see now. This is the day we visited the clockwork laboratory.</p><p>One after the other, the metal arms let fly a bullet. Each time, the researchers write something down, fiddle with this or that, then reload and repeat the experiment. It is what my father calls “fire-control systems research,” and I find it equal parts fascinating and horrifying.</p><p>I spent more time with Father after Mother passed. I wonder what he had thought about that?</p><p>My father was never much of a talker, but I don’t recall him uttering a single word about my mother’s death. The question of why this is sits quietly in my mind as we stand in the laboratory, but eventually I find myself inquiring about another matter:</p><p>“Why did we start conducting research into clockwork soldiers, Father?”</p><p>I don’t really care about this matter. I just want to talk about something,<br>anything.<br> I want to hear my father speak, because if he does, maybe it will lessen the gnawing fear of him that sits eternally in my heart. But his answer only strokes the flame of my disconcert:</p><p>“One’s superiors do not often give their answers,” he says. “I am superior to all—including you—yet one day this crown will lie upon your brow. Perhaps I will hear your thoughts of this matter at some point.”</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, my father turns on a heel and departs.</p><p>But can I follow him?</p><p>Do I even have the right?</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Dark Eyes<br>[<br>]</p><p>I dreamt of my past: memories of my mother, recollections of my father.</p><p>Rarely did I dream after I left on my journey; days of my childhood, images that paid me a visit for the first time in many years, were enough to fill me with nostalgia. The sensation was so powerful, the time back then so different from now, that it almost caused me to raise whines of misery.</p><p>I wondered if what my mother said to me back then was true.</p><p>I wondered what my father was thinking about when he spoke to me that day.</p><p>As the questions from my dream arose, the sight before me warped once again. Heaven and earth flipped; light and shadow melded.</p><p>Would these be memories of another time?</p><p>The next thing I know, I’m standing in a run-down shack. Before me I see someone’s back, one I am familiar with. I know right away what this is—I am in the process of repairing his clockwork body.</p><p>“I am sorry, my prince.”</p><p>There is a slight crackle to the voice I hear from over his shoulder—dust must have gotten into his sound box.</p><p>But it’s my fault that he was injured. My symptoms had gotten worse, and he had taken a blow meant for me instead. I couldn’t fault him for that. I tell him that I should be the one apologizing, but he shoots me down. He is so kind to me, and that’s why…</p><p>…That’s why I’d been wondering this whole time if I’m just a burden to him.</p><p>He supports me, and so is doing all he can to help stop the war. He is powerful, yet gentle—I always wonder if there had been a different, more effective path that he could take to make my vision a reality.</p><p>All I can do for him is repair his clockwork mechanisms. And if I were ever to teach someone else how to do it, then he would have no more use for me.</p><p>The unease bubbles within me and I give it voice: “Should you really be accompanying me on my journey, for the sake of my dreams?”</p><p>He falls silent, shocked. Terrified of the quiet, I immediately apologize, but the silence still hangs heavy over us.</p><p>He says nothing. Nervous, I lean over and peer at him…to find that his eyes had gone dark and still, his operations ceased.</p><p>My unusual question had caused an error in his operations that day.</p><p>I reprimanded myself: I shouldn’t bring these sort of things up during repairs, and frantically returned to my work.</p><p>And so, I never heard what his answer had been to my question.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Closed Eyes<br>[<br>]</p><p>Dreams come to me, one after the next. I dream of life when I was young, of things that have recently happened—all of them moments important to me. And yet, why do I dream of such things<br>now<br>?</p><p>Pain steals my consciousness, wiping away my thoughts. The sights before me slowly fade away. Now I understand: I’m waking up.</p><p>I slowly lift my eyelids, but can no longer sit up. In fact, I can scarcely move. The pain is a weight that shackles me to this place. I had forgotten all about these things in my dreams: the ruined church, the illness that prevents me from moving. Ah, if only it<br>was<br> a dream.</p><p>Though my eyes can barely focus, I see a figure move. The brim of his hat is wide and round, and he peers at me with worry. It is clear he has been watching over me even as I dreamed. I want to speak to him, but my strained throat can produce nothing but a harsh rasp. It seems our days of long, fulfilling chats are now over.</p><p>As I tense, he lifts me into his arms and sets me down atop an old, weathered pew. My body relaxes as I sink into it. It’s much easier to breathe here than when I’m leaning against the wall, and I’m so relaxed I have trouble keeping myself awake. Yet despite my newfound ease, I am still unable to produce any kind of sound.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought enters my mind, as true thing as I have ever experienced: If I close my eyes now, they will never open again. And so I muster all of my strength to force out a sound. I have to speak to him. I<br>must<br>.</p><p>He has traveled with me across land and time.</p><p>He is my best friend.</p><p>And this is the end.</p><p>“Thank you”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>At last, I manage four meager words. He initially tries stop me as I desperately reach for my voice, but then falls into silent thought. Finally, after a long pause, he says:</p><p>“—“</p><p>Alas, my ears can no longer hear his words. But strangely, I know his message regardless.</p><p>Thank you,<br> I say to myself.</p><p>Thank you,<br> I say, repeating the words over and over in my mind like a mantra until sleep finally steals up and claims me.</p><p>In the end, my dreams never came true; I was not powerful enough to end our endless wars. And yet, there were people who stood by my ideals. Not many, of course, but some of them eventually agreed to form a third party that could act as mediators for various warring nations. They were small in scope, and it would be a long while before they had the pull to bring negotiations to other countries. But I had lit the spark. And hopefully, that spark would one day burn brighter than any fire of war and bring peace to the world.</p><p>I want to believe this. For the sake of all those days I spent traveling with him, I want to believe it more than anything.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Throne in the Sky<br>[<br>]</p><p>Oh, you want to know more about him?</p><p>He was born the eldest son and first prince of a royal family. When he was young, his father started a war, but he was a kind boy who found this hard to accept. I hear he wanted to preserve peace for the people, so he turned his back on his country. Isn’t it nice he got to choose a life for himself?</p><p>Sadly, he took after his sickly mother. His physical condition—coupled with his kind, pacifist disposition—made him unpopular with ministers, soldiers, and his own father. Even the citizens occasionally besmirched him, asking him to stop blindly believing in the good of people’s hearts.</p><p>But even with all that, Mama thinks his thoughts and words saved a great many people. If he ever became king… No. It’s<br>because<br> he never became a king that he was who he was.</p><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Kingship<br>[<br>]</p><p>My son was born today—our first child.

Yet she understood this, which is why she gave me the throne that day.</p><p>And yet, I cannot help but think on how she paid a great price for our child. How was he going to live? What would he bring to this country?</p><p>I looked at his face before they were taken away.

I remain confined to a distant base in anticipation of an emergency that will never happen. Almost 365 days have passed since I was stationed here. In a futile attempt to stave off my boredom, I fiddle with the fake red flowers Pod gave me to celebrate the occasion.</p><p>I’m sick to death of being bored. Isn’t there anything fun to do? I grumble, drowning in my excess of time. Pod then makes an irritated gesture and reluctantly shows me some data.</p><p>It’s data I’ve never seen before in my work. Rather than rows of numbers, it’s packets of natural speech. As I debate internally on whether or not to read into the data, Pod begins to slowly read the data aloud in a gentle voice. To my surprise, it’s a tale of the human world.</p><p>A story of a<br> and his<br>. Together, amidst the fires of war, they travel to meet those who have been harmed. So humans weren’t born solely to wage war. It’s the first time I feel any interest in learning about humanity, and it was enough to bring color to my dull life.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>My days in this distant base were meaningless and dull, but Pod’s stories transformed that boredom into elation. My appetite for stories whetted, I ask for more. But Pod says to me, “Maybe another day.”<br>, I think to myself,<br>.</p><p>Making sure Pod doesn’t notice, I search for the source of these stories and hack into the server where information on humanity is kept. Just as I expected, I find a number of stories. Bingo! Stingy little Pod… I mutter as I lose myself in the data.</p><p>Before long, I find myself going back to the story about the boy. I want to read it for myself. However… I find that quite a bit differs from what was read to me. Or rather, the story itself is… The words are…changing… Dancing.</p><p>If I sound the alarm, Pod will find out my secret. But I want to save the boy’s story. Without further hesitation, I call Pod over. If it’s angry with me, then so be it.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Let’s quit our traveling. We’ll never stop this war… The boy huddles in a shed. His attendant pats his back to comfort him. Pod and I jump into the overwritten story and gaze at the changed boy and his attendant.</p><p>Is this really him? He seems like a different person… The boy gave up on his journey. The story data is corrupted. A little black bird sits perched on his shoulder. We conclude that the bird is the source of the corruption.</p><p>We quietly approach the boy from behind and shoo the bird away. But the boy remains withdrawn. Contrary to our expectations, nothing changes.</p><p>Analysis: We…may have been too late, Pod says. The story may be contaminated to its very core. I ask how we can fix it, but Pod says there’s nothing we can do. It’s a hopeless situation. But I refuse to give up.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>The tale of a sweet, but short-lived boy… The first story Pod ever read to me. It’s impossible to repair the corrupted story data, and so I decide…that simply means I’ll have to rewrite it myself from scratch.</p><p>I rely on my memory alone to manually repair the story. Along with Pod’s assistance, I slowly but surely rebuild the boy’s life. And at last…the story is complete. All that’s left is overwriting the old story with the new, completed one.</p><p>With a sigh of relief, a question comes to me: why would a mere story be saved so deep, under so many layers? It’s almost as though humanity’s memories themselves are being carefully protected… A thought akin to fantasy crosses my mind. “Pod?” But in that moment, a bright red flower bursts a hole through my chest.</p><p>I’m s※○△y—I did not want you to r□○□○ze the tr□□□. I will be fighting the black ※※※※※ on my own ※○w. I turn around to see P※□ in the ○△※ with its weapon. From the □□□□ in my chest s※○lls my □※△○※ies of Pod, all of the stories… I must…gather them…</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Yuzuki"><a href="#Yuzuki" class="headerlink" title="Yuzuki"></a>Yuzuki</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>It happened when I started elementary school.</p><p>I used to come home crying every day. I was extremely shy, and my classmates saw that weakness and took to bullying me. I’d try to wipe the tears away and put on a brave face, but Mom always knew. She’d ask if something happened, and I would just nod. She never said anything else; she’d just sit there and quietly stroke my hair.</p><p>I remember moonlight pouring in through a window. I used to lie in her bed while she sang me a lullaby. I don’t remember the words exactly, but it went something like this:</p><p>“Though the moon stands alone in the night sky, its gentle light shows the way for everyone else.”</p><p>Part of my name means “moon”—Mom apparently named me after the lullaby. She wanted me to be the kind of person who helped others.</p><p>Even if no one sought me out specifically.</p><p>Even if I didn’t fit in.</p><p>The moment she told me this, I swore to become the moon.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I was shy as ever when I started middle school.</p><p>Everyone else could just strike up conversations with perfect strangers, and they all had tons of new friends within the first week. I couldn’t begin to fathom how their brains worked. But I was used to being alone.</p><p>Around that time, I saw a boy in glasses being bullied in a secluded staircase. The bullying was typical—even cliche. Like something you’d see in a bad movie. The timid boy was surrounded by a group of larger classmates. They were pushing him around. Demanding his money. It was painful to watch.</p><p>The boy in glasses eventually pulled out a thousand-yen note from his wallet. But the moment he did, a bucket of water came crashing over the bullies’ heads. They were soaked from head to foot.</p><p>“We’ll get you for this!” they shouted as they ran away.</p><p>It was me, of course. I’m the one who threw the water. And then I watched as they scurried up the stairs and escaped to the floor above.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>After I helped the boy in glasses escape his tormentors, I was reminded of Mom’s lullaby.</p><p>Maybe I really<br> help others.</p><p>After that, I made a point of stopping bullying whenever I saw it.</p><p>Like that day in science class…</p><p>When the classroom skeleton with limbs attached to string suddenly started dancing.</p><p>Or the day on the landing…</p><p>Where a wave of ping pong balls came clattering down the stairs.</p><p>Each time, the bullies ran away howling with their tails between their legs. I loved seeing that; it was such a hilarious contrast to their usual invincible air. But the last time I stood there laughing as the bullies scattered, I heard a voice behind me:</p><p>“Was that you?”</p><p>It was the boy in glasses. Though I’d helped him from the shadows again and again, that was the first time he’d spoken to me. Unsure what to say in response, I could only bring myself to nod.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>That day, the hum of cicadas provided a comforting background noise as the sun set over the school. I stood waiting at the gates. The boy with glasses had asked me to walk home with him. When was the last time I left school with someone else?</p><p>Brilliant orange light reflected off the windows of skyscrapers as we made our way home. We walked in perfect silence. Honestly, I had no idea what to say. But though I felt somewhat lost, I also felt a strange sense of comfort.</p><p>We passed through the busy part of town and came to an empty street. When we did, the boy with glasses finally spoke:</p><p>“Please don’t bother me anymore. Things are easier when I’m being bullied. I don’t want to be a loner like you.”</p><p>We parted ways after that, and I took my usual route home. The moon shone lonely against the pitch-black curtain of night.</p><p>I stared at the sky the entire way home. The sharp edges of the beautiful moon blurring beneath my tears.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Moonlit Solitude, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Divergent Phenomena: Record 202809</p><p>The city is an empty gray expanse.</p><p>A uniformed group marches through the rubble-strewn streets—a 20-person platoon dispatched by the organization. One boy—quiet by nature—walks behind the rest. His eyes suddenly drop to his feet, and what he sees there steals his words away.</p><p>White powder is strewn over the pavement, blown here and there in the wind. It is salt. But this is no ordinary mineral; this has come from human corpses.<br>White chlorination syndrome<br>. Those afflicted by the disease find their fate in one of two ways.</p><p>One: Their bodies turn to salt and they die.</p><p>Two: They lose themselves and become monsters called<br>Legion<br>.</p><p>The quiet boy makes a sound then: a small yip. In an attempt to avoid the blowing salt, he has lost his footing. But he does not hit the ground. A uniformed girl behind him grabs his arm, effortlessly keeping him upright.</p><p>Shocked by her strength, he opens his mouth to thank her. But her mouth widens in a mischievous grin, her crooked teeth on full display.</p><p>“You tripped on nothing there, man! Goddamn, you really are the Feeble Kid.”</p><p>The boy draws a breath to reply, but finds himself too intimidated to speak.</p><p>“Cut it out,” says another girl as she twirls her red hair with a finger. “Us rejects need to get along.”</p><p>The girl with crooked teeth turns her savage gaze towards the redhead.</p><p>“Who you calling a reject?”</p><p>“You. Me. All of us. Haven’t you noticed? This platoon is made up of underachievers.”</p><p>She speaks the truth. The platoon is comprised entirely of rejects. This mission is their last chance to remain with the<br>organization<br>. But the girl with crooked teeth does not accept this.</p><p>“I bet the people up top are worried about the reject platoon, so they stuck me here as insurance.”</p><p>The platoon’s mission is to venture into an unexplored area and find a specific individual. Said individual is a researcher. Eyewitnesses claim that though he is afflicted with white chlorination syndrome, he retains his mental faculties. They must find this man. If they do not, the platoon will be out of chances.</p><p>“Hey, c’mon,” says a small boy with uneasy eyes. “Stop fighting.”</p><p>This boy knows the girls will argue forever unless he intervenes. His voice is nasally. His eyes twitch. He is the very picture of a coward. The girl bears her crooked teeth at the cowardly boy and hisses, sending him scuttling away.</p><p>The quiet boy gives the rowdy trio a sidelong glance. Sighing, he turns his gaze to the sky and examines the gloomy violet cloud that hangs low over the city.</p><p>It’s coming.</p><p>He knows this. He has known it since they first set foot in the city two hours and forty-two minutes ago. Rain is on the way, a torrential downpour with lightning, wind, and fury.</p><p>The quiet boy hoped conditions would improve, but it is not to be.</p><p>“Guys?” he says. If a storm is incoming, they need to change their route. But no one replies. Instead, they come to a sudden halt and fix their eyes on a spot. Color slowly drains from their faces.</p><p>“Legion,” whispers a platoon member. Their voice is despair. A skyscraper stands on the edge of collapse, its metal frame bared to the open air. And behind it, Legion. This is the fate of a person who becomes infected with white chlorination syndrome and loses control.</p><p>Its outer shell is hardened bone—a cross between an insect and a crustacean. And it is easily over 130 feet tall. Fear and bewilderment race through the platoon; they had no warning so massive an enemy might be waiting for them.</p><p>Humans of flesh and blood—and rejects at that—stand no hope against it. It is so unreal, the platoon has trouble accepting it. The Legion slowly turns to look at them. Time is short, now. As a single screaming mass, they turn and run into a nearby ruin of a building.</p><p>Behind them, the monster’s howl causes their ears to bleed. The building in which they sought shelter shudders, scarcely holding together. The Legion is attempting to smash the building and everyone inside it. The platoon members shudder in terror, their minds threatening to break at any moment. All except the quiet boy. His breaths alone remain measured. Steady. Calm.</p><p>He stares out the window and thinks. Beyond the shattered glass, small droplets of rain quickly turn into a torrential downpour. Flashes of lightning illuminate gray clouds, followed by thunder nearly as loud as the Legion’s howl.</p><p>Suddenly, realization strikes. He knows how they can escape—and more than that, how his platoon of rejects can defeat the Legion outside.</p><p>“I have an idea,” he says. The cold steel in his voice instantly stills the panic rippling through his fellows.</p><p>Prompted by their gazes, he begins to explain. He tells them how they can get out of this despair. About his one-in-a-million bet. The platoon hesitates at first, but they eventually realize it is the only hope they have. At least it’s better than waiting for death.</p><p>The quiet boy runs up a set of collapsing stairs to the roof and looks down over the city. Positioning himself somewhere with a clear view of the city below, he begins issuing orders that he hopes will get the Legion’s attention.</p><p>First up is the cowardly boy, who bursts from the building and begins to run. He is the swiftest of their group. He is the lure for the Legion. The bait. His fellows make sure the path is open for him. The girl with crooked teeth uses superhuman strength to remove piles of rubble, creating the shortest route to the target location. The rest of the platoon helps as best they can, clearing a path for the boy as he races past.</p><p>The Legion lumbers after him, growing ever closer. But just as it is ready to reach down and rend the cowardly boy in two…</p><p>“Hey, dummy! Up here!”</p><p>The redheaded girl’s voice echoes around the ruined city. From atop a nearby roof, she fires a bullet that knocks the Legion’s hand away.</p><p>Every member of the platoon knows what they must do, and they give their all to the effort. All is going according to plan. Because the quiet boy understands the strengths of his reject platoon. Finally, coward and monster arrive at a suspension bridge on the verge of collapse. A gaping hole yawns beneath it.</p><p>Aging wires extend from worn-out towers, barely holding up the bridge deck as it sways in the storm. The bridge groans as the massive creature steps upon it. A flash of lightning streaks across the sky, covering the empty city in blinding white light. The entire platoon looks up as if in prayer.</p><p>A loud rumble rips apart the sky. Lightning has struck the bridge’s supporting tower. Wires twist and snap as the deck begins to give way. The cowardly boy dashes across the undulating surface and leaps to safety. But the Legion is not so coordinated, and it stumbles to the side.</p><p>As it does, the bridge finally gives way, plunging stone and wire and beast down into the abyss. It wails as it falls, giving voice to madness. Though it is unlikely to be dead, the Legion will not be crawling up anytime soon. The platoon rejoices at the quiet boy’s brilliance.</p><p>He knew lightning always strikes the highest point. So he had them lead the Legion to the bridge in the hopes a bolt might strike one of the towers. It was not so much a strategy as a last gasp—yet when he proposed the idea, everyone trusted him completely. There are no casualties. The reject platoon lives on. And in that moment, they all begin to praise their newfound savior.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Moonlit Solitude, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A platoon of rejects has been given a mission.</p><p>They are to find a researcher who is afflicted with white chlorination syndrome, yet retains his faculties. On the way, an unexpected enemy appeared: a monster known as Legion. But they worked together to overcome the threat.</p><p>…Or so they thought.</p><p>“Come in! I repeat, come in. Do you copy? Over!”</p><p>The quiet boy stands atop a skyscraper. He speaks into his wireless communication device and attempts to issue orders. Yet the only responses he receives are the death throes of his platoonmates. They are the last thing he hears before communications cut off entirely. They avoided one Legion threat, but a total of six were lurking in the area.</p><p>The quiet boy has strategic prowess. His companions have hidden powers. Yet a mere twenty of them cannot hope to take out multiple Legion. They requested backup from the organization, but none is coming. They are cornered now. Trapped. Doomed to annihilation.</p><p>He hears his companions screaming for help before Legion howls drown them out. Unsure what to do, the boy stands frozen. He prays this hell might pass him by.</p><p>A sudden quiet descends like a hammer. The rampaging Legion go silent. Then they whirl about as one and begin marching away. They retreat before cornered prey. The boy does not know what is happening. Regardless, it is a miracle. His prayer has been answered.</p><p>His surviving platoonmates slowly make their way to him. They cradle bloody corpses in their arms: remnants of their fellows. Thirteen corpses lay on the floor of a ruined building—including that of the cowardly boy. He was quick, and agreed to act as bait. But he was not fast enough to escape the other Legion, and when they caught him, they tore him limb from limb.</p><p>“This is all<br>your<br> fault!” cries the girl with crooked teeth as she grabs the quiet boy by the collar. Her bloodied face twists into a scowl of rage.</p><p>“I knew we never should’ve followed the Feeble Kid.”</p><p>The Feeble Kid. The organization’s commanding officers use this insult whenever they want to ridicule the boy. And he can never argue with it.</p><p>“Enough,” says the redheaded girl. “The Legion retreated. We’ve got a chance.”</p><p>The other girl snarls in response.</p><p>“You know they only retreated because they were responding to something, right?”</p><p>The girl with crooked teeth’s lips tremble in fear.</p><p>“This means there might be a<br>Red Eye<br> nearby.”</p><p>Red Eye.</p><p>The nickname for intelligent Legion—those whose eyes glow red. They have the ability to control other, mindless Legion, which makes them infinitely more terrifying. The thought that a Red Eye might be in the area makes the quiet boy drop his gaze.</p><p>When he does, his vision alights on the arm of the girl with crooked teeth. He sees white skin in the tears of her sleeve. White. Like salt.</p><p>“Your arm…”</p><p>At his words, she looks down at her arm and gasps.</p><p>Those affected by white chlorination syndrome meet one of two ends: They either turn to salt and die, or become Legion. Her face twists in despair as she realizes the future that awaits her.</p><p>And she is not alone. Of the seven survivors, three are infected. Legion. Red Eye. White chlorination syndrome. The platoon has been plunged into the depths of despair. But there is one hope.</p><p>If they can find the researcher who has white chlorination syndrome and yet retains his intelligence…</p><p>Then maybe, just<br>maybe<br>, they can be saved.</p><p>“We keep going,” says the quiet boy. “Now let’s move.”</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Moonlit Solitude, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>A platoon of twenty has become seven after a battle with the Legion.</p><p>And three of those are infected with white chlorination syndrome. Those afflicted by the disease find their fate in one of two ways: They either turn to salt and die, or become monsters called Legion. Yet the platoon has not surrendered hope.</p><p>The organization has given them a mission. They are to find a researcher who is afflicted with white chlorination syndrome, yet retains his sense of self. If they can do this, they may learn of a way to best the disease. They believe because they must.</p><p>Twilight. Boots clack over a cold floor. The smell of chemicals moves through the boy’s nose. The platoon slowly picks their way through a research facility. The researcher should be here somewhere.</p><p>They were lucky not to encounter more Legion on the way here, or the Red Eye that controls them. But as they venture through the facility, disappointment colors their faces.</p><p>The corridor is quiet as the dead. Clumps of salt lie scattered at their feet. The girl with crooked teeth walks beside the boy. Though her expression remains haughty, her hands, white with disease, quiver slightly. The redheaded girl speaks to her kindly.</p><p>“It’s okay. It’s going to be okay. We just have to find the researcher.”</p><p>After wandering the halls of the silent facility, they find the researcher’s name tag. It rests atop a pile of salt in the shape of a human. The boy turns away from his despairing companions and reaches for a sheaf of research documents next to the pile. He flips through the pages and finds accounts of white chlorination syndrome. There is no going back. No cure. Once a person contracts the disease, there is no way to recover.</p><p>With that, their last thread of hope goes taut and snaps. A researcher who retains his wits despite the disease? It is nonsense. Madness. All the boy can do is chuckle.</p><p>The Legion. White chlorination syndrome. After battling for so long against despair,<br>this<br> is what greets them. He crumples the documents in his fist and begins to roar with laughter. A fist of white.</p><p>There are seven survivors. All of whom are now infected. Their bodies no longer obey. All they can do is huddle together in the darkness. The backup they requested is nowhere to be found. They cannot proceed, and they cannot go back.</p><p>“Hey,” says a small voice, breaking the silence. It is the girl with crooked teeth.</p><p>“Sorry for calling you Feeble Kid.”</p><p>Her apology delivered, she slowly begins to tell about herself. As if she is looking back on her life in the face of oblivion.</p><p>She wanted to do more for the organization. But she didn’t get along with the brass, and before she knew it, she was labeled a reject…</p><p>“Sounds familiar,” chuckles the redhead. Nods move around the room; all of them are a slightly different version of the same story.</p><p>At first, they all dreamed of being outstanding members of the organization. But once they were labeled as rejects, loneliness crushed whatever hopes they once had. Yet as they sit in this place and slowly turn to salt, they find themselves filled with a shared happiness. If this is to be their end, at least they are able to share it together.</p><p>“What about you?” asks the girl with crooked teeth. “What did you dream of?”</p><p>She turns to the quiet boy, who thinks carefully for a moment.</p><p>Then he answers.</p><p>“I wanted to be a person worthy of my older sister.”</p><p>Beyond the window, the large moon hanging in the night sky casts a faint rainbow across the clouds. The boy’s calcified hand catches the light and shimmers like a crystal. Looking over the room, he sees the same pale glow surrounding each of his new friends.</p><p>There are worse ways to go than this<br>, he thinks as he lets his eyes slip closed.</p><p>Morning comes. He wakes to a scream. The girl with crooked teeth is no longer smiling. Instead, she has torn the throat out of one of their companions. Madness has taken her. She will become Legion. The redheaded girl turns her gun on the thing that was once her friend. But she cannot pull the trigger.</p><p>The quiet boy bites his lip and shuts down his own emotions. He snatches the gun away and shoots the maddened girl through the head. Five now remain, including himself. They all thought they would sit in that place and wait for death.</p><p>But as that shot rings out, something happens. The organization’s reinforcement helicopter finally arrives, the rumble of its landing shaking the facility. A voice comes from static.</p><p>“Do we have any survivors here? Please respond.”</p><p>The boy replies in a quiet voice, gazing at the corpses of his comrades as he does.</p><p>Five living. And with nothing to show for it. They are taken into organizational custody, leaving the salt-drenched facility behind. And though they have lost much, despair has been held at bay for the moment.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Moonlit Solitude, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>They are a small platoon of rejects sent into battle by the organization.</p><p>Though white chlorination syndrome encroaches on their bodies, they have returned home from a Legion-filled hell. Despite paying a heavy price, they have obtained a key piece of information: The researcher who was said to retain his intelligence while living with the disease does not exist. Once it is contracted, there is no way back.</p><p>In a deep recess of the organization’s base, the boy lies on the floor of a cage. His skin is white. Frozen. He can no longer move. The disease has almost reached its end.</p><p>How did things end up like this?</p><p>After risking their lives for the mission, all that awaited them were endless tests in a cramped and filthy cage. Dimly, the boy hears a woman scream. He slowly turns his gaze outward. A four-limbed monster thrashes wildly.</p><p>She used to be a girl. A girl with red hair.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>He hears more sounds. A door opening. Boots on cold tile. The boy’s commanding officer and subordinates have entered the room. He stares at the monster as it thrashes.</p><p>“This experiment is a failure,” he murmurs. “Kill it.”</p><p>There is a gunshot. And another. And another. Each time, the monster’s screams shake the darkened room. By the time it falls silent, the boy’s vision is bathed in red. Words of animosity choke from his whitened throat.</p><p>“I hate you…”</p><p>Their mission had been a lie.</p><p>The researcher had been a lie. The mission’s true objective was to send the platoon into unexplored areas to see if they would catch white chlorination syndrome. At which point, the organization could observe its progress.</p><p>The redheaded girl had figured it out some time ago. After being taken off to one room or another, she’d gotten a look at some files. The night she told him, a large moon had hung in the sky—just like the one he’d seen above the research facility. She quietly tapped on the ground as she spoke.</p><p>“We’re experiments. That’s it. That’s all.”</p><p>The boy did not believe her at first. But now he understands. They were just cogs in a great wheel of deception.</p><p>“I have to thank you,” says the commanding officer. He stares down at the boy with cold eyes.</p><p>He goes on to explain that the appearance of the Legion had been a surprise. They thought the platoon would be wiped out, but when the boy saved them, the mission—the experiment—was able to continue.</p><p>“Sadly,” concludes the officer, “we have fewer samples than initially estimated.”</p><p>The boy does not know how long he has been here. As his body weakens, his hatred grows. It is an angry emotion. Red.</p><p>“We just wanted…to do our best…”</p><p>The officer tilts his head at the words.</p><p>“What are you talking about, Feeble Kid? You<br>did<br> do your best. These experiments will serve our better personnel quite well indeed.”</p><p>The smiles of his companions flash through the boy’s mind. They all dreamed of helping the organization. But now those dreams have been scattered to the winds. In that moment, something snaps deep inside the boy.</p><p>The light in the room turns red. Sirens begin to wail, signaling a Legion attack. Screams echo throughout the base, followed by the wet sound of rotten fruit thrown against a wall. The commander and his men are baffled—and afraid. Things are moving far too fast for them to control. Suddenly, the door is torn from its hinges.</p><p>White aberrations—Legion—tear chunks from fleeing researchers. Meat slips from bone like a glove leaving a hand. Blood. Slaughter. Death. A feeling settles in the boy’s chest as he watches from his cage. It is not fear. Nor is it despair.</p><p>“Heh… Ha ha ha…”</p><p>His small, dry laugh slowly grows louder. He guffaws madly as he writhes on the floor, laughing and laughing until he is covered in blood and vomit and bile. The feeling…is delight. These people had ridiculed him and his comrades. Called them rejects. Toyed with their lives. And now the bill has come due.</p><p>At last, the Legion stands before the boy. Its aberrant hands tear open the cage with ease. But he is not afraid. Instead, he closes his eyes and patiently waits. And waits. And<br>waits<br>.</p><p>But the end does not come. Instead, the Legion kneel before him and bow their heads. Bowing before his bright red eyes.</p><p>Kill them. Kill the enemies of our Gods. Kill them all.</p><p>Voiceless thoughts fill his head. When he hears this, he finally understands what he has become.</p><p>Red Eye.</p><p>A being who exists to control the Legion and end humanity. It is his presence that brought the Legion here. The boy—the Red Eye—slowly gets to his feet. The commanding officer huddles in the corner. He slowly strides over to him.</p><p>“Please!” cries the man. “No!”</p><p>He looks at the boy and the Legion behind him as he begs for his life. The man will do anything to live, including flattering the enemy of all humanity.</p><p>“I always knew you were special! I knew it! And you could use that power for the organization! You’re nothing like those rejects! Nothing!”</p><p>His platoonmates—his friends—were all dead. Yet even now, this man cannot help but trample upon their memories.</p><p>“This would have never happened if you didn’t send us into that godforsaken place.”</p><p>The Legion rips the officer to shreds. The boy grinds chunks of meat beneath his heel as he strides out into the corridor.</p><p>Legion perch atop unidentifiable corpses, bowing to the boy as he passes. He takes them into his procession with a smile. When they find a living member of the organization, he kills them. It is revenge. Revenge for himself and his companions. Revenge for being named rejects. Revenge for being discarded.</p><p>At last, silence descends over the base. There is no one left to slight the boy; this place belongs to the Legion now.</p><p>The boy approaches a bowing Legion and gently runs his hand over its body. His crimson eyes turn to the window. The brilliant moon hangs in the clear night sky. Shining over the bloody fortress as though in celebration.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

I used to love Sundays when I was little. It was the one day of the week I got to spend with Mom, Dad, and my little brother. We’d always make lunch together.</p><p>And cooking is<br> an adventure for a little kid. I’d try to copy the cooking video playing on the tablet, but every time I went to crack an egg, things got…interesting. I’d go through an entire carton trying to get it right, and Dad would laugh each time I didn’t.</p><p>One day, I<br> got my egg in the pan with a minimal amount of shell. I whispered the magic word for my secret flipping technique and…</p><p>“EEEEEK!”</p><p>My brother poked the ticklish spot on my side, causing the egg to smear all over the pan. He was always such a little jerk…</p><p>Anyway, I draped the remains of the egg over some golden rice and called it good. Then I drew a smiling sun on it with ketchup and gave it to Dad.</p><p>“This looks just like you,” he said. And just like a sun, I beamed.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>It was the first parents’ visiting day of my elementary school life. The unusual prospect of a family visit set the class abuzz. Even our teacher—who was terrifying when angry—seemed nervous. Dad even took off work so he could come.</p><p>Our first class of the day was social studies, followed by science and math. Whenever the teacher asked who knew an answer, I waved my hand over my head like a crazy person and screamed, “Me, me, me!” Dad watched as I breezily wrote the answer down on the blackboard.</p><p>In our final class, the students had to give a presentation about the origins of our names. Everyone seemed embarrassed by their parents’ reasons for choosing names. But I was ready. The day before, Dad said they named me Hina because it means “sunshine.”</p><p>, he’d said.</p><p>When I was finished, my teacher told me my name suited me perfectly.</p><p>“You<br> have a very bright smile! It always cheers me up.”<br>My friends all agreed, and I felt like I was going to explode with pride.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>When I got to high school, our family underwent a seismic shift. My parents got divorced. We used to cook together on the weekend. Go on trips together. Now everything was different. I thought happy families like ours only got ripped apart in TV shows.</p><p>I ended up living with Dad. He was mentally and emotionally broken, and no longer smiled like he used to. He’d just lay down and stare into space. Even breathing seemed to cause him pain.</p><p>The people around me all worried about him. Teachers. Counselors. Friends. They constantly asked if I was doing okay, and seemed to be searching for a way to connect with me. But I just smiled and said everything was fine.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t. Even if I was miserable. Because as long as I kept smiling…</p><p>I thought there was a chance Dad would go back to his old self.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>The days following the divorce turned into weeks. Months. I tried everything I could think of to get our lives back, all while going to school. I just wanted a life like everyone else. But if Dad and I ever wanted to get there, I was going to have to put in some serious work. And I had no idea just how far we’d actually fallen.</p><p>One day, I was having a mindless chat with a friend on the phone. We were gossiping about random things at school. Near the end of the call, she got serious and asked if everything was okay at home.</p><p>“Everything’s fine!” I replied in a chipper voice.</p><p>I ended the call. The screen went black. I could see my reflection in its surface, my face strained under the weight of a false smile. And in that moment, I understood everything.</p><p>My parents chose my name because they wanted me to smile as brightly as the sun. But it quickly became a curse that bound me. Because no matter how hard or painful my life…</p><p>Everyone expected me to have a brilliant, beaming smile on my face.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>An Ocean Sunset, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Divergent Phenomena: Records 202005-202806</p><p>2020 - Tokyo</p><p>The ruined city lies covered in a thick layer of cloud.</p><p>The soft patter of rain echoes through empty streets.</p><p>Amidst the still and silence, a young voice emerges from the second floor of a crumbling building:</p><p>“It’s okay. A kiss will make the hurt go away.”</p><p>A young girl gently affixes a bandage to a scratch on her little brother’s knee.</p><p>The pair have been drifting through the ruined city for days, as though running from something.</p><p>Wet clothes. Dry throats. Empty stomachs. Lost parents.</p><p>All these anxieties and fears weigh heavy on their minds.</p><p>Suddenly, there is a quick, faint shudder in the earth. They hold their breaths and grip each other tightly. The ground shudders again.<br>It’s getting closer.<br> They grasp each other’s clothes as the shaking grows greater. More intense. They know what is causing it, and that knowledge is a horror.</p><p>But then, the tremors come to a stop. And the bleached white bones of a monster’s eyes peer through the building window.</p><p>2028 - Harbor</p><p>A girl stands on the deck of an escort vessel docked at a military harbor. Clad in a military uniform, she gazes up at the sky. It is the same girl from the abandoned city. She now stands in the warm sunlight, lost in thought. Years have passed since that day; she is no longer a scared little girl, but a soldier.</p><p>“The general is asking for you, Captain,” says a boy in the same uniform. She turns around, smoothing hair mussed by the ocean breeze. “I’ll be right there,” she says softly.</p><p>The girl walks into the ship’s control room and finds a number of officers gathered. None are older than twenty; all wear the same worried expression. The general—the same one who has summoned them here—begins his brief in terse tones.</p><p>“In our previous operation, some of you retreated from the front line without my orders.”</p><p>The purpose of the previous operation was to capture<br>Legion<br>. Legion are white monsters with bone-like shells, and the greatest threat humanity has ever known. The<br>organization<br> the girl belongs to was formed for the sole purpose of eradicating Legion. Talented personnel have been gathered from across the world to dispatch the monsters wherever and whenever they crop up.</p><p>Just a few days prior, the girl and her squadron engaged multiple Legion in battle. But faced with greater enemy numbers than anticipated, several of her soldiers lost their nerve and ran. Now those same soldiers sit in the briefing room with sweat running down their bodies. The general opens his mouth to scold them—perhaps even punish them—when the girl suddenly speaks.</p><p>“I issued the order to retreat, sir” she says.</p><p>Her squad turns to look at her in surprise. She issued no such order. It is a lie. Yet she tells it in order to protect those who serve beneath her. “As the leader of this squad, our failure is my responsibility alone. If there is punishment to be had, permit me to take it in their place.”</p><p>The general stammers in the face of his subordinate’s sudden confession. But he quickly regains himself and informs the girl of her punishment:</p><p>Her squad will be assigned to maintenance and cleaning duties about the ship. Said vessel’s purpose is to transport some precious cargo overseas. The ship must be fueled and prepped for the journey, then made ready to depart with all speed. Though the girl and her squad are combat personnel, they will now be used as the most base of laborers.</p><p>“I expect this ship to be ready to depart by nightfall,” continues the general. “Once preparations are complete, return here.”</p><p>“Should you fail, a number of your squadron will be discharged—no matter where the true fault lies.”</p><p>It is an entirely unreasonable demand, but the girl only nods.</p><p>A moment later, she and her squad gather around a map of the ship on a nearby wall. The girl runs her finger across the map, calling out names as she glides over each room. When everyone has their assignments, she turns to depart.</p><p>“Begging your pardon, ma’am?” says a young squad member. “But the jobs you gave yourself are…terrible.”</p><p>The boiler. The morgue. The sewage tanks. The girl has taken on the most demeaning and horrific tasks for herself. “Oh? I didn’t realize,” she responds with a smile before dismissing her squad to their work.</p><p>They say no more as they scatter to their stations. The girl makes for the morgue straightaway. Here she finds bodies of those who perished during the voyage, having suffered grave injuries in the last battle with the Legion. She follows the medical team’s orders and disposes of the bodies, praying they might find peace in the next life.</p><p>Afterwards, she moves through the ship, taking care of preparation, maintenance, and cleaning in each of her assigned areas. Footsteps echo throughout the ship as her squad rushes to and fro. Crew members offer cheerful greetings as they slip by in cramped hallways. A warm, comfortable breeze blows through the ship as it prepares for an arduous voyage.</p><p>Once she is finished, the girl makes her way to the control room, where the deadline is looming. If she is even one second late, the general will dismiss her squadmates without mercy or recourse. After a moment’s hesitation, she pushes open a rigid door to take a shortcut to her destination…</p><p>And finds herself in a storehouse far too large for the ship. In the center lies a sturdy cage that contains the massive Legion they captured the other day. This is the creature to which so many of her squad lost their lives. In an instant, she understands the nature of the ship’s “precious cargo.”</p><p>She gazes upon its white body, covered by a shell that looks like it might belong to some manner of crustacean. Part of it is stained a deep red, perhaps because it absorbed blood. The left arm is cracked and shattered like porcelain—damage sustained in the recent fight. Images of her squadmates being torn to shreds replay in the girl’s mind.</p><p>The Legion’s head moves slightly as it turns to look at her. Its eye sockets are empty. But when their gazes lock, a different emotion roils inside of her. She feels as though it sees straight through her, and so looks away.</p><p>Less than two minutes remain until the deadline. The rest of her squad has finished their tasks, and now waits for the girl in the control room. Fifty seconds left. Thirty seconds. None can hide their unease—their entire lives now lie in her hands. With ten seconds to spare, the girl bursts through the door.</p><p>“Sorry to cut it so close!” she says with a grin. Though he seems disappointed, the general announces there will be no further punishment. Muttering his displeasure, he leaves the control room.</p><p>Seconds pass after he leaves. The remaining squad members exchange glances…</p><p>Before bursting into a raucous cheer.</p><p>“We knew we could count on you, Captain!” they say. Some laugh. Some shed tears. They crowd around her, reveling in a shared joy.</p><p>The girl has always been willing to place her life on the line for her squad. She is skilled in both martial and intellectual pursuits, as well as capable and kind. She is, in short, the finest leader any of them could ask for. And as the sun dips below the horizon, its few remaining rays shine over them as though giving a blessing.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>An Ocean Sunset, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>2020 - Tokyo</p><p>Tokyo lies abandoned.</p><p>A girl and her little brother huddle in a collapsed building, hiding from a monster called Legion. As its earth-shaking footsteps grow closer, the monster’s massive face appears in the window. They hold their breath, waiting for it to leave. But no matter how hard they pray, it does not go.</p><p>After a moment of stillness, the monster wails and leans against the building, where it has apparently decided to take its rest. Though the girl’s brother is on the verge of tears, she takes his hand and attempts to lead him out quietly.</p><p>I’m the big sister. I need to stay focused.</p><p>Because if that thing sees us, it will be over in a moment.</p><p>How much longer would they have to live through this hell?</p><p>2028 - An escort vessel, at sea.</p><p>After finishing refueling and maintenance at the military harbor, the escort ship sets off across the ocean. The girl gazes at the cloudy sky through the windows of the officer’s quarters.</p><p>“Four hours until we get there,” she murmurs quietly. “Guess I’ve got time to read.”</p><p>The whole squad enjoys a rare bit of downtime as they sail.</p><p>Their mission is the transport of a massive Legion to a foreign research facility. Once there, it will be researched so anti-Legion weapons might be produced. It is a vital mission—one which may well lead to the end of the battle between humanity and the Legion. Once they dock, they will have to transport the creature overland. As it is likely they will encounter more of the Legion; the girl and her squadron are under orders to guard the cargo.</p><p>With their lives, if necessary.</p><p>The squad is painfully aware of this truth. But for now, they rest to regain their strength. Suddenly, an emergency broadcast echoes through the ship:</p><p>“Alert. All personnel, report to the control room immediately.”</p><p>A minute later, the crew is lined up neatly in the control room. They all wear serious expressions, their relaxed moments from the beginning of the voyage a forgotten dream. The general informs them the ship has received a request for support from their destination. The harbor was attacked by a horde of Legion with no warning, and they are presently engaged in a fierce battle. Their ship has been asked to aid in the fight.</p><p>If possible, they will assemble a vanguard unit and dispatch whatever Legion remain once they make landfall—a most dangerous mission indeed. The general pauses, clearly preparing to ask for volunteers. But the girl takes the initiative and volunteers to lead the charge. The moment she knew someone was being attacked by the Legion, remaining on the ship became untenable.</p><p>She quickly issues orders, assigning her unit various tasks. Some prepare first-aid kits in the infirmary. Others ready a submarine for infiltration. She leads the rest of the squad to the armory.</p><p>They gather black swords, handguns, grenades, and communication devices. Though the squad grumbles about having their rare moment of downtime interrupted, the girl does her best to put their minds at ease. Once they are outfitted, they prepare to leave the armory. But then something shakes the ship. Something<br>massive<br>.</p><p>As an alarm wails to life, a voice crackles over the PA system.</p><p>“We’re under attack! We’ve got ten Legion on the deck—twenty! There’s more! More are coming! Someone get up here and—“</p><p>There is a crunching sound, followed by a bloodcurdling scream. Then silence.</p><p>The ship is under attack. But why? Why would the Legion be attacking a vessel so far out at sea when the creatures live on land? It is a baffling situation, and panic immediately sweeps over her squad.</p><p>“What’s going on!?”</p><p>“We’re nowhere near the harbor yet!”</p><p>“We need to get on deck NOW!”</p><p>A window shatters. Metal groans.</p><p>“Why are they even here!?”</p><p>“Why is this happening!?”</p><p>“We’re gonna sink! We’re all gonna drown!”</p><p>The girl moves to each soldier in turn, calming them. Once they have themselves under some semblance of control, she whirls around and rushes to the main deck. Though she has survived countless battles with the Legion, this is a scenario she has never before encountered. She prays her unit can somehow remain safe as she flings open the door to the main deck. As she does so, the top half of a human torso comes skittering through the door and down the stairs.</p><p>One of the Legion stands on the deck, its arms covered in fresh blood. It howls, its voice terror incarnate. She has never seen such a creature before. A carapace clings to its back. A hard shell covers countless thin legs and tentacles. Fin-like protrusions wriggle from openings across its body. It is a monster that has adapted to life in the ocean—a kind of crustacean.</p><p>And now it and its fellows are launching a surprise attack at sea. Legion clamber up the side of the ship, shattering windows and wriggling their way inside. Screams ring out. Horror reigns.</p><p>“No,” whispers the girl. “Not here. Not like this.<br>I won’t let you<br>.”</p><p>As one of the monsters turns in her direction, she tightens her grip on her sword and prepares to fight.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>An Ocean Sunset, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>2020 - Tokyo</p><p>As rain pours over an abandoned Tokyo, a young girl and her brother hide in a dilapidated building. The white monster called Legion has crouched near their hiding place to rest. They are attempting to slip away without alerting the creature. But when they open the door, it makes a piercing, metallic scrape.</p><p>They pray the rain drowns out the sound. But it is not to be. The Legion lifts its head and peers into the building. The girl feels as though her eyes have met the monster’s. It has found them. They are going to die. The girl hides her brother in a futile attempt to save him. The monster reaches out, likely to idly crush them with a single massive hand.</p><p>2028 - An escort vessel, at sea.</p><p>An escort vessel has met with an ambush at sea. A horde of Legion crawls from the sea and into the ship. But on the main deck, a girl and her squad fight back.</p><p>The sound of machine gun fire is incessant. Deafening. The girl deftly dodges wildly flailing arms. After several hundred shots, the creature finally falls over and lies still.</p><p>But they can find no joy in subduing a single foe. The girl asks her fellow soldiers to guard the deck, then makes her way inside to take out whatever has infiltrated the ship. She prays to save as many of her squad as she can.</p><p>She runs through the ship at full speed. Each time a cry for help comes over her wireless system, she runs for the source. She knows the layout of the ship like the back of her hand. When she moves, it is always along the fastest route. Suddenly, one of the Legion juts its head into the hallway in front of her.</p><p>Without stopping, she draws her sword and leaps into the air. Her blade flashes like a meteor. Sword meets sheath as she lands. As she continues her mad dash down the hall, a head thumps to the floor.</p><p>The girl fells several Legion by herself as she moves through the ship. Using her handgun and precise marksmanship, she pierces the skulls of smaller enemies. She explodes Legion heads by kicking ammunition meant for the ship’s cannons. She is the distinguished leader of an elite unit whose sole purpose is to eradicate the Legion. And now, all of her skills are being put to the test.</p><p>Each time she clears out a new area, she checks on the survivors. All who can still fight are sent to the deck to help ward off further attack. The despair in peoples’ eyes slowly clears whenever they hear her voice. She is a single ray of hope in the gloom.</p><p>As she and her squad form up, they slowly push the Legion back. The ship is barely holding together. Casualties are great. But if they can keep it up…</p><p>She mulls over the situation as she runs down another corridor.</p><p>Suddenly, there comes the high-pitched shriek of metal, followed by a violent shudder.</p><p>“Status report now!” cries the girl into her comm.</p><p>The news is even worse than she feared. The hull of the ship has been torn open and water is rushing in.</p><p>For a moment—just one—she closes her eyes.</p><p>“<br>What should I do?</p><p>How many will die?</p><p>There are still Legion inside the ship.</p><p>I have to locate the enemy.</p><p>I have to kill them.</p><p>Is everyone safe?</p><p>I have to protect them.</p><p>How far is land?</p><p>We’re going to sink.</p><p>How did they breach the hull?</p><p>We’re going down.</p><p>We need to close off flooded areas.</p><p>Was I not strong enough?</p><p>There must be some way out.</p><p>I have to get everyone out.<br>“</p><p>Despair fills her being, threatening to overwhelm her.<br>Her heart beats faster. Faster.<br>Faster.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>An Ocean Sunset, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>2020 - Tokyo</p><p>In a ruined Tokyo, a girl and her brother have been discovered by a monster called Legion. The enormous creature reaches out to kill them. The girl places herself in front of her brother and closes her eyes. But then, the sound of gunfire and shattering rock rumbles through the air.</p><p>She cautiously opens one eye. Then another. The Legion’s splintered body collapses to the ground in a cloud of white dust. Moments later, young soldiers in military uniforms rush to her side.</p><p>“You’re all right,” says the voice of salvation.</p><p>This deadly game of hide-and-seek has lasted for days. The girl’s brother begins to bawl as he is released from overwhelming unease. As the young girl holds him tight, powerful emotions well up from the depths of her heart. She wants the strength to protect what is most precious to her. And at the same time…</p><p>2028 - An escort vessel, at sea.</p><p>Sirens wail throughout the escort vessel. A hole has been torn in the ship’s hull, and it is beginning to sink. The survivors are mired in despair, but the girl alone refuses to succumb to it.</p><p>She activates her comm and speaks to whoever is left.</p><p>“All crew, abandon ship. I repeat: Make for the submarine and abandon ship. This is an order.”</p><p>All who are able drop what they’re doing and race for the submarine.</p><p>Minutes later, roughly forty souls are gathered in the hanger. It is less than half the number they started the voyage with—and the girl will not permit any more to be lost. The survivors clamber into the submarine. Once they’re safely inside, the girl looks up at the lone figure beckoning her from the open hatch.</p><p>“No,” she says. “I’m staying here.”</p><p>“Captain, no! Don’t say that!” As the soldier reaches for her hand, a Legion tears the hangar door from its hinges. Suddenly, the meaning of her sacrifice is clear: If she does not stop the remaining Legion, the submarine will never get clear of the ship.</p><p>She orders the submarine to push off as quickly as possible.</p><p>“Don’t die, Captain!” she hears over her comm. “We’ll come back for you!”</p><p>“All right,” she replies with a grim smile. “Now go.”</p><p>She turns her back on the sub as it begins to slip free of the ship.</p><p>Fearsome howls echo through the hangar for a time, as well as the clash of steel on bone. The creatures almost seem to be mocking her. Later—she knows not how long—she steadies herself against the wall of the hangar and looks out at the trail of dead. Her bones are shattered. Her body is pain. But she is not finished.</p><p>She still needs to escape. As water fills the halls, she finds herself losing the sense of up from down. But then, a deep rumble fills the air. Something is coming. And she knows precisely what it is.</p><p>Their cargo—the entire reason they set off on this transport mission—slowly rises up before her. The massive Legion has rent its cage asunder and is now wandering the ship.</p><p>This<br> is what tore the ship apart. Water rushes in. Every movement is agony. An enormous foe looms in her path. Yet in the face of this hopelessness…</p><p>The girl smiles.</p><p>She drops low and swipes her blade at the Legion, her wounds forgotten. She dodges the arm it brings down and plunges her blade into the thin joint between bones. She is glee. She is<br>delight<br>.</p><p>This is her secret—one she has kept hidden ever since the day she awoke in Tokyo…</p><p>The city was a gray ruin. It was the day the organization saved the girl and her brother from the Legion. As she cradled her sobbing brother, she turned her face from him. Because she was smiling.</p><p>The girl suffered from a stress-induced psychiatric disorder, one that developed as a result of constantly protecting her brother. This illness led her to volunteer for increasingly dangerous assignments.</p><p>Like when she shouldered punishment in place of her squadmates. Or when she volunteered to lead the vanguard after receiving the SOS signal. Or when she single-handedly rid the ship of Legion. Each time, the stress of the situation sent waves of ecstasy flooding through her system.</p><p>“It’s…over…”</p><p>But now, her chest fills with an unfathomable emptiness as she stands atop the Legion’s shattered corpse. She gently lifts the monster’s decapitated skull in her small hands.</p><p>“Thank you for amusing me,” she says before pressing her lips to an exposed piece of bone.</p><p>The ship slowly slips beneath the waves. A girl clings to a broken secret amidst a broken world. And a metal vessel carries this secret into the depths. Moments later, the waves wash quietly atop one another as though nothing was ever there at all. And the rays of sun that shine between the clouds bathe the ocean in a soft and fleeting light.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

Where am I? Why am I here? I can’t remember anything. My memory has abandoned me. I had something I needed to do, right? I<br> had something I needed to do. I find it difficult to gather my thoughts. Suddenly,<br> appears in my consciousness.</p><p>“I’m afraid this all comes at a cost. You’re going to lose your voice, your senses, your—“</p><p>“Are you certain?” A voice…</p><p>That’s right. I lost it all. My will. My speech. My hope.<br> This girl in white…<br>Pain constricts my chest. Stirs my empty memory. I know that girl. She was… She was my… Argh, I can’t remember! Who<br> I, anyway!?</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>These hands. These legs. This body. Am I… human? No. I’m not human. I<br> human. I got this body when I accomplished my objective. In this bleak world, I ate the dreams of people and desired to become human above all else…. But why is it so damn<br>? I’m finally the human I wished to be, so<br>?</p><p>“You need to collect more dreams, dear.”<br>That voice echoes in my head again. Now that I’m human, why do I have to do this? Fragments of memories pierce my heart like thorns. An impatience I don’t understand drives me forward. The girl in white. Me, a human. I have to do<br>. Otherwise there’s no turning back. That’s all I know.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>That should have been my only goal in life. But now that I’ve accomplished it, not only am I not happy… I don’t even understand these feelings of guilt roiling inside me. I wander the darkness with no destination. I have no way to tell what happened to my face. But this slender physique… This fluffy hair… The collar and manacles that clamp down on me… Oh yes, I know<br> who I am. The girl in white—I can’t get her out of my head. Who is she? Why do I look like her? What did I do to her? What did she do to<br>? I hear the sound of water splashing in the darkness.</p><p>“Hey, Mr. Monster?”</p><p>“When you become human, will you still be my friend?”</p><p>I know she said… Yes! She<br> say something! My scattered fragments of memories slowly come together…</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>How long have I been asleep? I sit up in discomfort and stand on the cold stone floor. I dreamt of the girl over and over again. What precious times we spent together. All my memories came back in my long sleep. Once again, I stand in The Cage. I need to go back to her as soon as I can; I need to give back what I have stolen.</p><p>“Well! Look who’s finally up.” An odd object floats up and speaks to me, pretending it has no idea what’s happening. I can’t imagine anything more audacious, but I will have to rely on the thing for now. I’ve lost so much—<br> much—but at least I have my memories. I retrace my steps through The Cage in order to save her. Once she’s back to normal, I will reply to the question I had left unanswered.

Deep in a mine that was sealed off centuries ago, he waits in perfect silence. Before him is an ancient dragon—an exceptionally diabolical creature. The dragon notices the intruder and gives a mighty roar that causes the mineshaft to shudder violently. A moment later, its throat begins to grow red with fire. The battle has finally begun. Two hours later…</p><p>MISSION COMPLETE!</p><p>Golden letters flash on the monitor. As the dragon lies motionless on the ground, the adventurers raise their swords and staves high.</p><p>The fanfare is accompanied by a blizzard of dazzling particle effects. Inside a dimly-lit room, the effects reflect off the glasses of a man facing his computer. He is deep into a raid in an MMO. It is an incredibly popular title, with a player base nearing almost one million members. The man and his fellow party members have vanquished the Ancient Dragon—which the most recent patched dropped as the game’s newest, most powerful enemy. The group chat is flying with exclamations of his online friends. Everyone is reveling in their victory.</p><p>nice work all</p><p>sry I died so many times</p><p>This was our first time seeing this, so it’s okay!!!</p><p>we won so its fine LOL</p><p>it was pretty much just Levania taking the stage tho haha</p><p>The man’s avatar is an alien creature named Levania. It is, of course, only his character’s name—not his own. The man types a message out to the party.</p><p>For me, this isn’t a game.</p><p>They retort with their own good-natured jabs.</p><p>YUP there it is! He said it!</p><p>What the man—no, what<br>Levania<br> said—was just an act for his friends. The party has been raiding together for some time, and they have an easy camaraderie among themselves. Theirs is a relationship of inside jokes among informal friends. But everyone knows the man had been the key figure in taking down the dragon. Without him, they likely would not have been victorious.</p><p>As the hands of the clock tick past one in the morning, his friends slowly begin returning to the real world.</p><p>alright I’m out</p><p>night!</p><p>i’ve gotta get up at 6 lol</p><p>I’m going to bed too!</p><p>later!</p><p>The man types “See you tomorrow,” and logs out. Regardless of how hard he works in the game, reality always claws its way back. The man gleefully crawls into bed and removes his glasses.</p><p>The next morning… The man stands on the train, moving his tired, empty eyes across the crowd packed in around him.<br>I’m sleepy,<br> he thinks.<br>I’m tired. I want to go home.<br> As these thoughts cycle through his head, the train pulls up to the station near his office. The man works as a mid-level engineer for a start-up IT venture called Dull, Inc.—the same job he’s held for the past four years. Each department holds a team huddle before starting the day. The meetings are an excuse for bosses to talk, check in on progress, announce schedule changes, and so forth. As the man’s boss drones on and on, he tunes him out and thinks back to the raid of the night before. He wonders what his actions in battle looked like to his friends. Had he successfully played the part of Levania?</p><p>Whenever he plays him, his personality changes. Levania is a leader who takes initiative; one who cracks wise with a keen sense of humor. Someone his companions can be honest with; a person both trustworthy and charismatic. But this person—this role—only exists in the game. In reality, the man is Levania’s exact opposite. He is introverted, stoic, and lacks even one true friend. He communicates only as much as necessary to get by in society, and has no desire to take any of his relationships deeper. Additionally, he is plagued by a vague, smoldering dissatisfaction of how unfair and irrational modern society is. The only thing that brings him joy are games. Whether he is playing the work of another or crafting his own, it is the only time his ever experiences happiness. His own game—which he’s been working on in his spare time—was reaching completion. It is an old-fashioned RPG where the player takes on the role of hero to save a princess captured by the demon king. And of course, the hero’s name is Levania.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Man in Life Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>“Hey! You listening!?” The man suddenly snaps back to reality. The team huddle is still going on. He sputters out a half—whispered apology for daydreaming, but it falls on deaf ears. Instead, the boss takes the opportunity to berate him.</p><p>“You know, you could stand to be a lot more productive.”</p><p>“Hell, we’ve got people with half your experience that are doing twice the work!”</p><p>The youngest member of the team graduated from college a mere two years ago, yet the boss misses no chance to praise him for his work ethic.</p><p>“But sir,” says the junior member suddenly, “he does a lot, too.”</p><p>“I have a lot to learn, but he’s always patient.”</p><p>“And he’s willing to help with whatever I need.”</p><p>Rather than easing off at this, the man’s boss doubles down.</p><p>“Do you see that!?” he roars.</p><p>“That kind of humble attitude is<br>exactly<br> what we need around here! Am I making myself clear!?”</p><p>The man glances at his coworker and sees his mouth twist into a sneer.<br>Gotcha!<br>, it seems to say.</p><p>Though the junior employee presents a humble, helpful front, he actually only takes assignments that are sure to earn him praise—leaving the dirty, difficult work to the man. He knows he’s the boss’s favorite, and uses this fact to his full advantage. And the boss thinks he’s found a new lackey, so he’s willing to let his sneaky attitude slide. The man knows what they both think of him: He is a target—a lump to be misused however they wish.</p><p>Lunchtime arrives. The man sits in the corner break area munching on a vending-machine pastry. A stout coworker approaches with a can of coffee in hand and gives it to the man.</p><p>“Rough morning, huh?” he says.</p><p>This stout man is an engineer who joined the company at the same time as him and now works on his team. Though not close enough to call each other friends, the man does not find his coworker’s thoughtfulness unpleasant. But he also knows him to be the type who tries to please everyone and avoid making waves.</p><p>“Anyway, hope it all works put.”</p><p>The stout man stands there awkwardly for a moment before shuffling back to his desk.</p><p>The day comes to a close. As the man is packing up to leave his boss approaches. He wonders dispassionately if he is in for another scolding. It turns out he is: his boss immediately tears into him for one thing or another. But no matter what he says, it will never resonate with the man.<br>This is just a job. It pays for food and a roof over my head. That’s all.<br> The man repeats this to himself as he waits for his boss to tire himself out.</p><p>Eventually, he finds himself standing on the train home. It’s full, but not uncomfortably so, and he has room to scroll through his phone as he rides. As he peruses his usual gaming news sites, an advertisement catches his eye. The game-development company that makes his MMO is looking for an engineer. He typically scrolls through advertisements almost unconsciously, but this one seizes his attention immediately and refuses to let go.</p><p>Later, the man sits down in front of his computer. Morning. He types a joking greeting in the group chat., and several people immediately respond.</p><p>morning</p><p>did you just wake up? lol its night already</p><p>yay Levania’s here!!!</p><p>He vaguely wonders why he feels so at home with these online strangers who he has never met, then sets the question aside. For the next few hours, the man and his friends run raids together.</p><p>But their attempts go miserably. The party is disjointed and out of sorts, and they end up failing apart at the end. The man apologizes for his poor leadership, and suggests a new strategy for their next encounter. His teammates are aware the loss is not the man’s fault, so they listen to his plan and offer up occasional suggestions or tweaks. It is a very constructive discussion. Eventually, as always, he must return to reality. His friends log off one after the other, their names disappearing from the screen. Then, one of them offers a parting remark.</p><p>I bet you’re really helpful irl too, Levania</p><p>It’s a compliment, the kind of casual thing people exchange a dozen times a day. But it causes a terrible sense of guilt to rise up in the man.<br>I’m fooling them. Lying to them. I’m nothing like Levania in real life. But if I could, I would love to be just like him…</p><p>Though his body cries out for sleep, the man logs out of the game and opens his internet browser. He arrives at the game developer’s website and navigates to the section on open positions. He doesn’t want his online friends to know what he’s like in reality. He doesn’t want them to be disappointed. But if he ever wants to change that, he will need to make a greater change to himself, stop drifting through life, and take some initiative. Levania would know what to do and put a plan in motion right away. In fact… After a brief moment of hesitation, he attaches his resume and sends it off.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Man in Life Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The man’s smartphone lights up as he receives a notification. He has an email from the game company congratulating him on passing their initial screening. Though the man hardly ever shows emotion, he smiles as he reads the email again and again.</p><p>Several months later, the man finds himself entering the doors of the company in his finest suit. He has spent the last few months burning the candles at both ends in order to complete his game and use it as a sample of his work. They were clearly impressed, because they invited him in for a face-to-face interview. Interviews have never been the man’s forte, but he has a plan: He will assume the role of Levania in his mind during the entire process. As they fire question after question at him, he tries to react as if it was another boss battle. It works better than he could have imagined, and his answers are both positive and proactive. As the interview ends, they compliment him again on his answers and his game, and he leaves the building floating on air. He heads towards the train station. The sky above him is a cloudless, brilliant blue.<br>I think I aced that interview. I really do. If I get the job, I’ll be reborn. I can be like Levania in my real life. Then maybe I can be my true self around my online friends…<br> As the man sets off for home, his face is alight with hope.</p><p>The next day… When the man arrives to work at Dull, Inc., he comes across the stout coworker and junior teammate having a serious conversation. Though he doesn’t like to eavesdrop, he finds he can’t help himself. Their hushed voices still carry across the empty office. It seems the junior employee has made a serious error in some of his work. Scared of how their boss will react, he tried to bury it. But he now realizes he will not be able to keep it hidden forever. Backed into a corner, he finally decided to seek out the other man for advice. After hearing the story, the stout man leans back in his chair and knits his fingers together.</p><p>“You have to tell the boss,” he says.</p><p>“Do it today.”</p><p>“The longer you put it off, the worst it’s going to be.”</p><p>Clearly dejected, the young man wanders off in a daze.</p><p>Later that afternoon… The stout employee is called into the boss’s office. The man can’t hear things clearly, but it’s obvious from the tone that the boss is chewing him out. A few words drift through the closed door, enough for the man to realize his coworker is being blamed for the junior employee’s mistake.<br>Why is he taking the blame? It wasn’t even his fault.<br> He glances around the room, and sees the junior employee and a couple of his friends looking over at the boss’s office and snickering behind their hands.<br>I am going to kill this guy.<br> He feels himself suddenly overwhelmed by terribly dark emotions. The man suddenly realizes what happened: The junior teammate had pinned the mistake on his coworker. He did so knowing full well their boss would never question the word of his favorite employee. Unable to stand it a second more, he pushes his chair back and begins walking toward the boss’s office.<br>Grant me your courage, Levania. Just this once.<br> As he nears the office, the conversation grows increasingly clear.</p><p>“You two were over there whispering earlier!” says the boss.</p><p>“Don’t deny it!”</p><p>The man knows exactly how this will play out. In the end, his poor coworker will take the blame. The man readies himself and opens the door.</p><p>“I’m busy here!” cries the boss.</p><p>“Can’t you see that!?”</p><p>The man pauses, takes a deep breath, and begins to tell his side of the story. After a few moments, his boss interrupts.</p><p>“I see. You’re in on this too.”</p><p>“Enough. Back to your desks, both of you.”</p><p>“I’ll figure out what to do with you later.”</p><p>When he hears this, the man feels his willpower drain out of him. Though he swore to be a stronger person like Levania, he’s still himself at the end of the day. He can’t even help a single coworker.<br>I’ve had enough of this company. I’ve had enough of me. I wonder if this fight would be too much even for Levania?<br> The man has no answer. But he knows one thing: Trying to fight a boss like him is pointless.</p><p>Several weeks later… The man receives a letter. It is a formal offer of the employment from the game company.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Man in Life Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The man receives a formal offer of employment from the game company. The next day, the man walks into his boss’s office and hands him a letter. It is his two-week notice. But it is also notice that he plans to take the rest of those two weeks off as vacation, and will only come back for his final day of work. He will still leave the job with far more vacation than he can ever use, but he doesn’t care. He simply wants to get out. His boss receives the letter coolly, showing no particular sorrow or surprise.</p><p>He then informs the team of his departure during the morning huddle. Soon, word spreads to the rest of the office. After the meeting, the stout coworker approaches the man and places a hand on his shoulder. “Thanks for all your hard work—and for trying.”</p><p>They both know what he is referring to: After the incident with the junior coworker, each of the men received a reduction in salary. The fact he was punished for the fault of another upset the man greatly. But there was nothing to be done. The stout coworker, never one to make waves, simply accepted the pay cut without a word and continued on.</p><p>That night… For the first time ever, the man and his coworker head out for a night on the town. Though his team held occasional drinking parties, he had never attended one. He never had a reason to. But this time, his falsely accused coworker had invited him, and they both understood it would be the first and last time such a thing ever happened.</p><p>At the bar… Alcohol works its dark magic and the man begins to open up. He talks about his favorite games, his next job, and his hopes and dreams for the future. He speaks of his desire to change himself. He has never laid himself bare like this; it is both liberating and terrifying. His tipsy coworker listens for a long time before finally responding, “I’ll be so lonely with you gone.”</p><p>Two weeks later… It’s the man’s last day at work. He leaves his house with a spring in his step. The thought of never entering Dull, Inc. again makes the packed train feel like a vacation. All he has to do today is finish some paperwork and sign a couple of documents. Once he turns in his security badge, he will walk out the front door for the very last time. Before he reports to security, he wanders the office looking for the stout coworker so he can say goodbye. But he can’t find him anywhere. He asks the junior teammate if he’s seen him and the man responds, “That guy? How should I know?”</p><p>Yet again, he feels his blood begin to run cold as rage overwhelms him. Perhaps his coworker called in sick. Perhaps he had a planned day off. With no other choice, the man finishes his paperwork and leaves.</p><p>He then makes his way to the station. He stands at the center of the platform, waiting for his train to arrive. It’s early, and the station is relatively empty. Tomorrow, he will begin a new life at a new company. He will never have to set foot in this station again. It is another in a series of goodbyes. A momentary feeling of loneliness quickly transforms into one of excitement.<br>Starting tomorrow, I’ll be reborn in a new world—one where no one knows me. I’ll be strong and reliable, just like Levania.<br> The light of hope shines brightly on the man’s heart.</p><p>A voice echoes through the station announcing the arrival of the next train.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>………………</p><p>Suddenly, something collides with the man from behind. He stumbles forward and goes flying onto the tracks.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Where are my glasses?</p><p>Oh god, I need to get back!</p><p>But the man finds himself frozen in confusion and fear. A lone figure looks down on him from the platform. It is muttering something.</p><p>“With you gone…” The man’s head snaps up. Standing before him was the coworker the man had tried to protect.</p><p>“With you gone…”</p><p>“<br>I’ll<br> be the one they bully!”</p><p>“I can’t<br>stand<br> that!”</p><p>“I can’t<br>stand<br> the thought of you being happier than me!”</p><p>“But with you gone—“</p><p>The shrill sound of a train whistle drowns out the rest of the thought. All sound stops. In a silent vortex of darkness, a few thoughts swirl:</p><p>I don’t want to die. I want to keep living.</p><p>Dreams… Hope…</p><p>Re…born…</p><p>I… I… I…</p><p>I…am…</p><p>Levania!</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Monster’s Instincts<br>[<br>]</p><p>“The dream-eating monster is a species that instinctually devours dreams in an attempt to secure a human form.

It’s my special place, and I don’t wanna tell anyone about it. I always come here when I want to be alone.</p><p>But one day, there was someone else here, which had never happened before. It was an older girl reading a book in the shade—I remember she looked kinda sad. I could tell right away she was a Noble: Her clothes were beautiful… And she was the prettiest person I’d ever seen in my life! After a second, she saw me staring and gave me a weird smile.</p><p>“You want this book?” She asked me.</p><p>“I’m done with it.”</p><p>I took it from her, but I was nervous the whole time; I’d never actually talked to a Noble before!</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The book she gave me was a collection of children’s stories. It had tons of pretty pictures, and I’ve read it every single day since. Each story was about a princess who fell in love with a prince. It was so different from my own life, and it helped me forget how sad everything was for me, if just for a little while.</p><p>But the book was also weird: All the pictures of the princesses had been scratched over with black ink… And the last page of every story was torn out. While I was certain all the princesses would live happily ever after… I also wanted to know how the stories ended, which meant I needed to find the Noble girl.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Eventually, I decided to go into town and look for her. It’s not just that I wanted to know how the stories ended—I also wanted to see her again. Because even though I knew we were worlds apart, I still thought I might be able to be her friend.</p><p>There was a lively wedding taking place in town that day. And while the pretty bride in her white dress was surrounded by crowds of people, she looked so very lonely. I recognized the bride right away. It was the Noble girl. Part of me wanted to run up and congratulate her, but I hesitated. Because even though everyone around her was smiling big, she looked like… she was screaming on the inside.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>I had a dream. In it, the Noble girl in her white dress was trying to tell me something. “Don’t lose ⬜⬜ ⬜⬜,” she said. As she talked, red started to spread out from her chest, staining her nice white dress. The color was far too sad for the nice Noble girl, and I woke up from the dream in a panic.</p><p>I went back to playing alone in the ruins. But one day, I noticed something stuck between a couple of stones. It was one of the missing story endings. It showed the prince and princess at their happy wedding. Later, I started hearing rumors in town:</p><p>But I know they’re not talking about the nice Noble girl, because all princesses get to live happily ever after.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Months before she was cast down to the lowest class</p><p>“Is this dress too garish?” My sister drew up her shoulders as she spoke, grasping the hem of her beautiful white dress. It was generously decorated in layer upon layer of delicate lace, with small diamonds sparkling here and there. I let out a small sigh as I stared at her. “You look lovely, my sister. And well you should, for today is certain to be the finest day of your life.”</p><p>My sister nodded, satisfied, and turned this way and that to better admire her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>We were twins, both princesses in the land we called home. Though we shared a visage, my sister was bright, sociable, smart, and popular. She was the very image of perfection. Whereas I was shy, dull, not at all clever, I didn’t have many friends… I was wholly unremarkable. This day, my sister was setting off on a journey to be wed to a foreign prince. It would be a grand ceremony on a scale I had never seen. Our country and the prince’s had long been at war, you see, but this wedding would unite our families and finally bring an end to the seemingly eternal conflict. It had all been set in motion by our mother—the queen.</p><p>The day was clear, and a warm sun sat high in the sky. Before stepping into the jewel-studded carriage, my sister turned to take a final look at the castle where she was born and raised.</p><p>“I will birth a son and raise the next king, Mother,” she said with pride.</p><p>“So wait and stay safe until then.”</p><p>With these words, she entered her carriage. Moments later, the carriage set off with great pomp. It would be several days before she crossed the border, so she settled in for a long ride. It sparkled in the sunlight, as though lighting the path ahead.</p><p>What a perfect beauty! What a perfect wedding! What a perfect prince!</p><p>I was so proud of my sister; seemingly nothing was beyond her reach, and she had accomplished everything she ever set out to do in life. I knew her future would be bright, with nothing but great things waiting for her. That’s how her life always was, after all. I waved and waved until the carriage vanished from view.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The girl slowly opens her eyes. Then closes them. She had been dreaming again. In her dream, she was a princess. She is disappointed that sleep has fled; she wanted to see more. For even though she wasn’t the lead princess in this particular dream, it was still much nicer than her usual nightmares. Defeated, she opens her eyes, gazes for a moment at the foul, grime-covered ceiling above, and rises from her shabby bed. Today, she will study hard, help however she can, and spend another day being a very good girl.</p><p>“Good morning, Mommy. Do you want to hear about my dream?”</p><p>She greets her mother cheerfully, as she does every day. The older woman does not even look up; she just continues peeling potatoes.</p><p>“Dreams are nonsense, girl, and you’ve no time for such foolery. Now eat your breakfast and get to school.”</p><p>On the table is a bowl of thin gruel and a heel of bread. The girl sits on a rickety chair and pulls the food close. The bread is hard enough to shatter teeth. But it’s all Commoners like them can afford, so she’s quite used to it.</p><p>“Last night’s dream was special, Mommy. I was a princess!”</p><p>Her mother sets a potato down and turns to stare at her daughter. Her eyes seem to bore holes in her.</p><p>“I told you to knock off that fool talk. You’re a Commoner, not a Noble—and you never will be.”</p><p>The girl is well aware of this.</p><p>Even the youngest child knowns of the country’s strict class system. Here, the disparity between Nobles and Commoners is great indeed. The Commoners have long been discontent with their lot in life, and the Nobles worry increasingly about social unrest. But the girl had no wish to argue politics—she simply wanted to make conversation with her mother. Stung, she drops her eyes and quickly finishes her breakfast.</p><p>“I’m going now, Mommy.”</p><p>The girl hurriedly gets dressed, gathers her things, and leaves the house for school. Winter. A most rainy season. Though the rain has stopped, puddles still dot the road. She stands at one and looks at her face reflected in the water. She does not look like her mother. Nor does she look at all like her father. She senses she is not much loved by either. And she believes her face to be the reason. Suddenly angry, she stamps on the face in the puddle and rushes off to school. She is determined to study hard and win her parents’ praise.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The roses were finally blooming. From my window, I saw the bright red flowers stretching out as far as the eye could see. The buds had been firmly shut for so long, but warm weather had finally come yesterday to loosen winter’s icy hold. But as magnificent as the flower garden was, I had grown so very weary of looking at it. I had been staring at it since the day I arrived in this country…. Since the day they locked me in this room. To pass the time, I started counting the roses. When I reached the 48th rose, I spotted the prince walking alongside his young and beautiful princess.</p><p>I knew the princess well. She was my twin, after all. A group of Nobles followed them, chattering merrily away. The castle, a fun and lively place for most inhabitants, hosted a tea party in the garden at this time every week. Delighted peels of laughter soon intermingled with the clinking of porcelain. I quietly slipped out of view and listened in.</p><p>“You have been beaming with happiness every day since the wedding, Your Highness.”</p><p>“People all across the land speak of the princess’s beauty!”</p><p>It was true: The marriage of a prince from the west and my sister from the east was on the lips of people in both countries. Of greatest concern was when she might bear him a child.</p><p>That was the reason I am here; the reason I was summoned to this place soon after the wedding was complete. Because I…I am to birth the prince’s child in place of my sister.</p><p>“Oh, I can hardly wait! Will it be a prince or princess?”</p><p>“No matter what, I’m certain it will be adorable.”</p><p>“I’ve heard His Majesty the King has already prepared several midwives for the happy day.”</p><p>It didn’t take long for the prince and his court to realize his new bride was barren. So I was smuggled into the country in the dead of night. No one could be allowed to know of my existence. Of course, I would do anything for my sister.<br>Anything….<br> I just thought she might come see me at some point.</p><p>“The sun is beginning to set.”</p><p>“You should not be out and about in the cold, Princess. Let us return to the castle at once.”</p><p>As the crimson glow of dusk began to fill the room, the lively voices grew distant. It seemed the party had ended. I moved from the window and began preparing myself for the prince’s arrival—for though my sister had not seen fit to visit, he arrived every night like clockwork. And there, in that darkening room, I waited.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The loud ringing of a bell pulls the girl back to reality. She had been unable to concentrate during class; she kept thinking about last night’s dream. The sun sits high in the winter sky, its rays peeking through gaps in the clouds to brighten the classroom. It was the continuation of her previous dream, the one where the princess rode off in a carriage. The girl is yet young, and while she does not understand her dream completely, she knows that Nobles sometimes have to do what their parents say and live a life not wholly their own. In this way, she finds being a Commoner a relief. And once she is grown up, she hopes to live a life of even greater freedom.</p><p>The school she attends is specifically for Commoners. Everyone, from the highest-ranking teacher to the lowliest student, is still a Commoner at the end of the day. The classroom grows lively as some of the more impatient children begin to gather up their textbooks.</p><p>“That’s all for today,” says the teacher.</p><p>“Oh, but before I forget, I have the results from last week’s test.”</p><p>The teacher looks directly at the girl and smiles.</p><p>“Your classmate here had top marks yet again. I hope you all learn from her and study hard!”</p><p>The girl happily hugs her textbook to her chest at the news. She runs the whole way home to tell her mother.</p><p>“Mommy, Mommy! Guess what!? I got first on the test again!” Her mother is standing in the living room with her back to her, holding a large mug in her hands. She slowly turns around at her daughter’s voice.</p><p>“If I study lots, do you think I could become a doctor or a lawyer?”</p><p>Her mother finishes off the contents of the mug—which is clearly some sort of alcohol—and slams it down on the table. The scent of her breath fills the room like a cloud.</p><p>“Are you mad, girl?” she says loudly.</p><p>“We’ve not the money to let you study forever.”</p><p>“Now clear your head of these fool dreams and get to the laundry!”</p><p>Dejected, the girl leaves to fetch the hamper. For a brief moment, a long-buried thought rises up in the girl’s chest:<br>What if she’s not my mother? We look nothing alike, after all.<br> She shakes the thought away.<br>No. I love her. Even if we aren’t related by blood…<br> But the poor girl’s desire for love has no outlet, so it simply continues to swell painfully in her chest.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Winter had arrived; the flower garden was cold and barren. But inside a heated room, a newborn baby made its first cry.</p><p>“Oh dear. A girl.”</p><p>The midwife holding the baby made no attempt to hide her disappointment; nor did the king and prince, who were both leaning against a nearby wall. With sweat running down my body, I instinctively reached out to hold the new life I created. But they do not even grant me that kindness.</p><p>“A shame,” said the king.</p><p>“Very well. Dispose of her at once.”</p><p>He and his son left the room without another word. But the princess—my twin sister—remained.</p><p>“You there,” she said to the midwife.</p><p>“You are dismissed.”</p><p>The woman froze in place for a moment. Then she set the baby down, bowed, and scuttled out of the room along with the rest of the women who attended the birth. The last time my sister and I were alone was a year ago—when I praised her exquisite wedding dress. But I lay still and quiet in my bed, unsure if I should view this as a heartfelt reunion or begin begging for mercy.</p><p>“This is your fault, you know? What I’m about to do? If you’d just given birth to a son, it wouldn’t have come to this.”</p><p>With that, my sister produced a small knife from her pocket…</p><p>…………</p><p>Cradling my newborn daughter, I ran from the castle with only the clothes on my back.</p><p>My mind was chaos.</p><p>They were going to kill my daughter. My own sister was going to kill her! Why!? Why, why, why!?</p><p>I had no answer to this question. But then again, I’d never been especially bright. I came to this wretched country for my sister’s sake. I bore a child for my sister’s sake. All for her sake. All for her sake all for her sake all for her sake…</p><p>I had nowhere to go. A traveling merchant kindly allowed me to ride on his cart, and after a night of hard travel, I woke up in a small border town. On the harsh midwinter morning, a mixture of snow and sleet rained down without mercy or pause. Having pushed my body to its limits right after giving birth, I was stricken with a high fever and fuzzy thoughts. But my sweet daughter was warm and dry in a thick blanket, and as I held her to me, my troubles seemed to dissipate. She was asleep. She looked just like an angel.</p><p>“Hey, there’s someone on the ground over here!” I heard footsteps splash in a puddle near my ear, and the voice of a young woman echo above my head.</p><p>“Heavens, she’s got a baby…” Another voice called out—a man this time.</p><p>“Aye, I fear this girl’s done for.”</p><p>“Poor thing. To think she’ll be leaving this child behind…”</p><p>They almost seemed to be talking about someone else. Apparently I collapsed, though I did not remember it. I could hear my daughter crying nearby. Despite how hard the sleet was coming down, I could do nothing for her; I did not even have the strength to stand. Thankfully, someone had found us. With great effort, I turned my head and looked at the couple. Please…raise her as your own. Make her happy. The words I had intended to say never made it from my mouth. The chill of the sleet pounding my body slowly faded away, the sound growing distant…distant…distant… And finally, my conscious faded….Forever.</p><p>……</p><p>………</p><p>…………</p><p>The girl briskly walks through a bone-chilling cold. Her mother had sent her out to fetch their bread ration. It’s a rainy winter day—just like the one from her dream. She is wearing every layer she owns, but the sudden downpour cuts through her garments like a knife. As she listens to the never-ending torrent, she thinks back on the sight she dreamed of that morning. Now that I think about it…<br>It’s funny how the couple that found “me” on the ground looked a lot like Mommy and Daddy…</p><p>“Mommy! I’m home!”</p><p>The girl, her pigtails dripping, produces three loaves of bread from the inside of her coat and grins happily. The bread is a bit damp, but dry compared to the girl. Her mother, who was warming herself at the hearth, takes the loaves with a bit of a guilty look.</p><p>“Thank you, girl. Now hurry up and get changed! You’re dripping water all over the house.”<br>As the girl slowly peels off her clothes, she only thinks of one thing: I hope that made Mommy happy…</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Rainy Winter, Sleeping Princess Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>“How long are you planning to sleep, child!? Get up already!” The woman throws the bedroom door open. Her daughter, who usually wakes up on her own, has slept late into the morning today. She stomps over to her tiny bed.</p><p>“Come now, get up. I need you to fetch the bread again.”</p><p>The woman throws back the blanket on the bed to reveal the girl lying there languidly, her face red.</p><p>“M-Mommy… I think I’m sick…” croaks the girl.</p><p>“I’m cold and hot all at once…and I c-can’t move…”</p><p>Her mother places a hand on her forehead. She is burning up. The woman immediately recalls how she sent her out in the sleet the previous day to fetch their food. Then she emits a small sigh and pulls the blanket back in place.</p><p>“Well then, never mind the bread. You just rest.”</p><p>“Th-thank you, Mommy…”</p><p>As the woman gets up and makes to leave, the girl calls out to her weakly.</p><p>“Well?” says the woman.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I wanna slurpy apple,” replies the girl in a pitiful voice.</p><p>“Is that okay?”</p><p>The woman stares at the child in the blanket. She never asks for things, she thinks. Without a word, the woman closes the door behind her. And to request slurpy apple—a grated fruit treat she used to make her when she was small—is even stranger.</p><p>She walks into the living room to find her husband peeling off his coat, still damp from his turn on the watch.</p><p>“Raining again,” he says.</p><p>“Awful stuff.”</p><p>The woman places a bowl of warm soup on the table. Her husband peers down at it, clearly disappointed, but she chooses to overlook this. With a small sigh, he digs into his meager meal. But after a few moments, he suddenly puts the spoon down.</p><p>“Hey, how’s the kid?”</p><p>“Feverish. I’m letting her rest today.”</p><p>“I swear, that child is next to useless.”</p><p>The woman sits opposite her husband and plucks an apple off the table.</p><p>“She came home soaked after her errands yesterday—probably what made her ill.”</p><p>She picks up a small knife and begins peeling the fruit.</p><p>“You sent her out in that?” says her husband.</p><p>“Hells, the other guards won’t even leave the barracks when it’s coming down so.”</p><p>The woman stops peeling and glares at her husband.</p><p>“Oh, so now I’m a magician who knows exactly when the rain is going to start and stop?”</p><p>Her husband wisely turns his attention back to his soup. The woman returns to her peeling.</p><p>“You know, she’s not a bad kid,” he says finally.</p><p>“You don’t have to be so cold to her.”</p><p>“Honestly, sometimes I feel like she’s…wasted on us.”</p><p>The peeled apple skin curls into a neat pile on the table.</p><p>“You’re right there,” she replies.</p><p>“Why, if she had our genes, she’d grow up to be a frightful beast just like us!”</p><p>The man looks down at his bowl again; silence was always his retreat when things weren’t going his way. The woman picks up the empty soup bowl, takes it to the kitchen, and returns with a grater. She slides the apple against it, creating a harsh rasp.</p><p>“You know I hate it when she rubs our differences in my face.”</p><p>The sound of the apple on the grater hangs heavy in the air.</p><p>“It’s almost her birthday,” says the husband. He stares out the window as he talks.</p><p>The rain is coming down harder, turning into sleet.</p><p>“I mean, not like we know exactly when she was born…”</p><p>“But we found her on a cold, rainy day much like this one.”</p><p>The grating slows as the apple is worn down to nothing.</p><p>“She’s starting to look like her mother,” says the woman after a long pause.</p><p>“Won’t be long until she realizes she don’t look like us at all.”</p><p>“Aye, that woman was a great beauty indeed.”</p><p>The woman glares at her husband again, but says nothing. Instead, she gets up and tosses the apple core into the sink. With the bowl of grated apple in hand, she returns to the girl’s room.</p><p>Her face is still red, but she is at least sleeping.<br>Pity this poor thing ending up with us when she could have lived a good, free life as a Noble.<br> The woman reaches out to touch the girl’s cheek, but stops. Instead, she places the bowl on the nightstand and leaves. The girl is beginning to realize she is not their true daughter. And yet, she does all she can to earn their love. But her looks aren’t the only thing that set her apart: there is also her purity, her honesty, and her bravery. The beauty of her very spirit tells the couple how different she is…. Perhaps they made a mistake taking her in that day. The apple sitting beside the girl begins to brown. It grows darker still. Uglier. Horrid. But the girl notices nothing in her deep, deep sleep.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>It is a terrible, terrible monster.

The image on the page displays an eyeless, ebon monster. It resembles a large insect, yet is somehow uncannily human. The sight makes the hair of all who see it stand on end.</p><p>The children take one glance at the picture and begin to scream with both terror and delight.</p><p>The tale of the monster has been passed down in this country for an age.</p><p>The picturebook which now entertains the four children is based upon it.</p><p>The girls enjoy themselves regardless—huddling close, laughing, scaring one another.</p><p>But then comes the sound of light footsteps—thin soles on flagstone.</p><p>The four girls look up from the book, their frigid gazes alighting on the source of the sound. It is another girl, her hair tied back in pigtails. Her head hangs low. On her neck and wrists are manacles and a collar, a symbol of her status as a Goat Person.</p><p>Goat People<br>.</p><p>That is the name for this nation’s lowest class of person. The Goat girl attempts to hurry past the other children, trying not to look at them as she does. And then…</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>The leader of the four gently calls out to the Goat girl.</p><p>The lone girl’s face brightens.</p><p>The leader’s personality can be a bit overbearing, but she is a good student, and her greeting sounds both pleasant and sincere.</p><p>The Goat girl is delighted.</p><p>But as she is about to return the greeting, she falls forward.</p><p>Her words are swallowed by cobblestone and shame.</p><p>The leader has tripped her.</p><p>She looks at the Goat girl and laughs, and her friends soon join in.</p><p>Goat People are the lowest of the low; they are meant to be abused without reason or cause. This idea has diffused itself among the young children.</p><p>The leader then speaks: “We are honored to be in the presence of a Goat Person this day, girls! Now…shall we play Monster?”</p><p>Play Monster.</p><p>In this game, one child takes on the role of the monster while the others pursue them. And, of course, the Goat girl is to take on the role of monster.</p><p>The other children throw the book at the lowly girl’s feet.</p><p>The open page shows the dark monster standing by himself.</p><p>He is hated. Just as she is. And so the girl begins to run. She runs and she runs and she runs—for she knows<br>terrible<br> things will happen if she is caught.</p><p>As she flees for her life, she eventually comes to a desolate and aging ruin. It is her precious, secret spot for play. Though it is typically worn and dirty, beautiful flowers bloom here at this time of year. After she ensures the other girls have not followed, she crouches down among the blossoms and breathes a sigh of relief. When her ragged breath finally calms, she lifts her head…</p><p>Only to be greeted by a surprising sight. The man-eating monster stands before her with his jet-black body and hideous insect wings. He waits silently among the colorful blooms.</p><p>“Are you…Mister Monster?” asks the girl. Her voice is a whisper’s memory. He remains silent. Suddenly, a thought comes to her:</p><p>We are the same.</p><p>The dark creature is her twin in all but name.</p><p>“Are you lonely, Mister Monster?”</p><p>She approaches him slowly. Flowers dance in the wind around her feet. “I think you are.”<br>Poor Mister Monster. Everyone hates you just like they hate me.<br> She gently places her hand on the silent monster. Strangely enough, she feels no fear. What she sees in front of her is not some terrible brute, but a creature who is alone no matter where he goes. A creature just like her. This is why she is not afraid.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>The Goat girl’s light footsteps echo across the plaza. She makes her way for the blossom-covered ruin. Her secret spot where the monster waits.</p><p>“Hey. You.”</p><p>A voice suddenly stops her in her tracks. She turns to find the four girls who are always playing in the plaza. The leader has called to her. “You haven’t been coming by lately. We miss you! Why don’t you play Monster with us today?” A cruel smile twists the corner of the girl’s mouth as she speaks. They want to play Monster with the Goat girl so they have an excuse to cause her pain.</p><p>The Goat girl’s eyes drop to the ground. She takes a quiet step backwards. “I’m sorry,” is all she says before dashing away.</p><p>The children exchange bewildered glances. The leader’s expression twists further. Her mind reels.<br>That<br>Goat<br> disobeyed me! ME!</p><p>Also, she’s been in a strangely good mood lately.</p><p>It makes me sick.</p><p>No Goat Person should ever smile like that.</p><p>The leader’s eyes bore into the girl’s back as she runs.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Red flower. Blue flower. White flower.</p><p>The girl’s voice echoes throughout the ruin, which overflows with colorful flowers. She moves around the aberrant monster, dancing ballet on a beat of three. Only recently did girl and monster meet, yet already they are in perfect sync. It’s as if they are partners—as if they have been dancing together for the whole of their lives.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>The girl dances.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Flowers nod.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>Wind blows. Petals flutter this way and that in the air.</p><p>Suddenly, the girl gasps in wonder, her dance coming to a halt. Both she and the monster look to the sky. They see petals soaring though the blue.</p><p>“Where do you think the flowers are going, Mister Monster?”</p><p>The monster does not reply. He is ever silent, never speaking. But the girl feels she hears his answer regardless. His voice is gruff, yet kind. Time spent alone with the monster is unbelievably precious to the girl. As a Goat Person, all she has ever known is abuse. But this lonely monster makes no attempt to wound the girl. This is why she hides away in the ruin.</p><p>It is so she does not have to face a painful reality. Yet while this is all happening…</p><p>A lone figure hides among the crumbling walls, quietly watching the girl. It is the leader of the children who play in the plaza. She thought the Goat girl’s pleasant mood strange, and so followed her in secret. And when she came to the ruin, she beheld a most confusing sight. The Goat girl was dancing by herself. Laughing by herself.</p><p>Mister Monster!<br>The leader watches in silence as the girl turns to empty space and calls to the monster over and over again.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The Goat girl’s bindings garner cold stares as she walks through town. But she does not care. For no matter what terrible things might happen, she has the companionship of a very kind monster. Yet another day finds her racing down the street for the ruin where the monster waits. Suddenly, she comes to a halt.</p><p>Smoke tickles her nostrils. Her face clouds. Something is on fire.</p><p>Knowing this bodes ill, she makes for the ruin as fast as she can.</p><p>I hope Mister Monster is okay<br>, she thinks to herself.</p><p>She soon arrives at the ruin. It is ablaze. Flames billow from a great pile of discarded junk. Broken chairs. Shattered clocks. The flames lick at the flowers, threatening to turn everything to ash. The ruin was meant to be a secret place for herself and the monster, and now it is lost.</p><p>“Mister Monster, no!” cries the girl. She sounds as though she could start sobbing at any moment. The monster is sitting listlessly in the middle of the ruin.<br>He’s going to die.</p><p>But as she leaps into the flames to save him…</p><p>“She’s here! The Goat is here!”</p><p>High-pitched laughter scratches the girl’s ears. She turns in the direction of the voice. The four girls from the plaza are waiting for her. Their leader takes a step forward, a lopsided smile on her face. In her hand she holds a stick, the tip smoldering with flame. She realizes these four are the ones who set the ruin to burn—the ones who stole her special place.</p><p>A black snake worms its way into her heart. She has never felt such an emotion before.</p><p>“You’re awful…” she mutters fiercely. “How<br>dare<br> you do this to Mister Monster!”</p><p>“Mister Monster?” The children exchange glances and begin to snicker amongst themselves. A moment later, the leader speaks.</p><p>“Your ‘Mister Monster’ doesn’t exist, Goat. He’s just a thing from a picturebook.” The leader had glimpsed the girl’s secret. She saw her playing by herself. She saw her speak to empty air.</p><p>“You poor thing. You must have been so<br>lonely<br>!”</p><p>Her words tear at the Goat girl like glass.</p><p>“Don’t you get it? You made the monster up!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl remains quiet, her eyes glistening under tears.</p><p>But then…</p><p>“No. He’s here. I know he’s here.”</p><p>She refuses to acknowledge it—she<br>cannot<br>. Doing so would mean her only friend does not exist.</p><p>“Are you okay, Mister Monster? You must be in so much pain.”</p><p>With teetering steps, she enters the flames. She finds herself entering an empty space. Flames lick at her legs. Her arms. But she pays them no mind. Because she can<br>see<br>. She sees the monster sitting amidst the fire, his body covered in burns. He is her precious friend.</p><p>Her hand brushes empty air. But to her, it is the monster’s cheek. She crouches down to pluck a single burning flower at the monster’s feet. Hot fire chars her palm. The pain is an idle thing. Distant. For she knows the monster suffers far more than she.</p><p>This is all<br>their<br> fault.<br>Her gaze rests on the burning flower.<br>Dancing flames reflect in dull eyes.</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Wish in Full Bloom, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The sun sets.</p><p>Darkness falls over the area. The once-dancing flames, now clinging to life, cast an eerie light on the ruin.</p><p>The children who started this fire are long gone, returned home to warmth and family. They had amassed the junk and lit the spark.</p><p>The ruin—the secret spot for the girl and the monster—is now little more than a wreck.</p><p>The girl stands silent. Alone. She stares at the monster, who is now a shriveled thing covered head to foot in burns.<br>Your “Mister Monster” doesn’t exist.<br> The leader claimed the girl’s monster was merely a vision. But the girl never had any intention of acknowledging that truth. Her monster is here. He is<br>right<br> here. Yet the children filled the ruin with garbage and set it ablaze all the same. They hurt her monster.<br>Hurt<br> him.</p><p>I will not let them get away with this.</p><p>A new emotion, dark and heavy, encroaches on her heart. She picks up a piece of kindling and sets fire to the tip, creating a torch. Then she begins to walk. Her steps are unsteady, as though possessed by some entity. She arrives at a beautiful house, a dwelling that resembles the magnificent homes one might see in picturebooks. It belongs to the leader of the children.</p><p>The girl lifts the torch. Her mind whirls as she stares into the flame. The leader of the children set fire to her ruin. She burned her monster. Which means… Which means…</p><p>Which means she can destroy her home. She can destroy what the other holds most dear.</p><p>Burn it all.</p><p>With darkness urging her on, she raises the torch high above her head and thrusts it forward. Fire crackles. Sparks fly. Before her, something begins to burn.</p><p>…It is the monster.</p><p>The torch never reaches the leader’s house. Instead…</p><p>The monster has leapt in front of her, letting the flames strike him. Almost as though he is trying to stop her.</p><p>“Mister…Monster?”</p><p>The monster falls face-first onto the ground, his burning body writhing in pain.</p><p>“MISTER MONSTER!”</p><p>She rushes to him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Mister Monster! This is my fault! This is all my fault!”</p><p>All she can do is weep. She repeats her apology as she clings to the monster’s blazing body. But then she realizes something…</p><p>The blaze enveloping him holds no heat. Because the monster is nothing more than a figment of her imagination. Somewhere deep inside, she had known this—yet acknowledging it was a weight too heavy to bear. Because the kind monster had always been by her side. And yet…she hurt him. The monster’s hand trembles and gently brushes her cheek. It is incorporeal. Cold. Yet she imagines warmth anyway.</p><p>He’s so warm…</p><p>It is a strange warmth, one that makes her feel the darkness which had overcome her heart is beginning to fade. The monster’s body quietly burns in the gloaming. It twinkles. It shines. Finally, it turns to ash and begins the long ascent into the sky.</p><p>“Goodbye, Mister Monster.”</p><p>I had so much fun.</p><p>I had fun dancing with you.</p><p>I…fun watching flowers…in the wind.</p><p>I…fun…you silently…my side…</p><p>And…</p><p>And…</p><p>The girl realizes something. As the darkness that had encroached on her heart fades away, so too do her memories of the monster. The monster has taken all of her twisted feelings with him.</p><p>“Thank you, Mister Monster.”</p><p>Her memories dim, then fade. Soon the girl does not understand why she is crying at all. Yet she continues to repeat herself.<br>Goodbye. Goodbye.<br> She does not fall silent until the final speck of ash has vanished into the heavens.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>……………………</p><p>The junk sits in a pile in the ruin. The beautiful spring blooms are gone. She is sad her secret place was laid to waste like this, but she is a Goat Person. It is to be expected. She repeats this to herself as she begins cleaning up the junk. “There we go,” she says as she lifts a broken clock. Suddenly she stops. Her heart catches in her chest. Beneath it, she finds a small flower still in bloom. The rest are blackened ash, yet this one alone remains. It shines brilliantly in the dark. A strange feeling suddenly bubbles up in the girl’s heart.</p><p>I miss you.</p><p>I don’t know who you are…</p><p>But I miss you.</p><p>We’ll play together when I see you again. We’ll be even better friends.</p><p>Bewildered by the sudden well of emotion, the girl falls to her knees beside the flower. She begins to pray. She does not know the name of whom she misses, nor what they look like. But whoever they are, they have given her such<br>warmth<br>.</p><p>And so, she prays she might one day see them again.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Angelic Sacrifice<br>[<br>]</p><p>Mama: If I were to describe her in a word, it would be…angelic!

They were all bigger than her—and probably four or five years older—but she kept making snowballs and throwing them as best as she could. That’s when I realized she was the only one without gloves, and that her poor hands were bright red. Yet she still wore a beaming innocent smile on her face, which made my heart hurt.</p><p>“Fio’s so cheerful, even on a frigid day like this.”</p><p>My husband, having just woke, came over to stand beside me, watching our daughter amidst the large crowd of children. Once he left for work, I looked for one of my old sweaters. He’d given it to me years ago and I’d always taken good care of it, so I figured it would still be in decent shape. After pulling it out of the closet, I unraveled it and began to knit a pair of gloves from the yarn, figuring the soft hues would look better on her than me, anyway. But when my husband came home that night, we looked at each other and burst out laughing, because he’d gone to town and used what little money we had to buy her a pair of mittens.</p><p>That night, I watched as our little girl, worn out from playing all day, snored softly in her sleep.<br>May these blissful days continue into eternity<br>, I prayed as I gently placed a small blanket over her.</p><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>
