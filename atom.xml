You’re not hurt anywhere, are you?" Said my mistress, the Lady Two, after felling the last of the monsters with her great sword. I knew she would ask; an disciple like me can fathom what the Intoner he serves might say before she says it.</p><p>"Not at all. Of greater concern is you, Lady Two…" The state of her own body was far more important than my own. After all, she had just finished slaying a Minotaur that was two… no, three times her size, and in the middle of a desert, no less. The sweltering sun rays and the merciless gales were just as much our enemies. In terms of unabated harshness, I could imagine no worse a battlefield in the entire world than the one we stood in now.</p><p>And yet all my Lady had to say was:</p><p>"I told you not to call me Lady! When we’re alone, you promised to just call me Two!” While puffing her cheeks out in annoyance. I would think my query in regards to the state of her health at the moment held more importance than that, but… the more I looked at those puffed up cheeks, I forgot my concerns, overwhelmed with the desire to poke them with my fingers since they were so cute.</p><p>"Forgive me. Two… are you uninjured?" Her puffed up, pouty cheeks turned into an ear-to-ear smile in less than a millisecond.</p><p>The truth is I hadn’t forgotten our promise. It’s just that I like seeing her make that face, so I sometimes pretend that I have. By doing so, I get to see her make two adorable faces in her row: first the cheeks, then the smile. I admit to being a bit of a schemer.</p><p>I’d also like to mention that there are two reasons why I prefer to refer to her formally. The first is, that it is proper etiquette. That is why I insist she let me maintain airs before the eyes of others.</p><p>The second reason, which I haven’t disclosed to her… is because her existence is one far more precious than my own. I should think any man, confronted by a woman so much more important than himself, would feel compelled to call her Lady.</p><p>That’s right; Lady Two, you are a million times more important than myself, handsome and multi-talented as I am. I’ll have you know, too, that there aren’t many people out there I’d so easily accept as being above me, either. Indeed, in that sense you are exceedingly rare.</p><p>This would hold true even were you not an Intoner. Our relationship as Intoner and disciple is a mere pretense. For example, if my master were a different Intoner and not yourself, I assure you that our relationship would be purely professional. Were it Lady One or Lady Three, Lady Four or Lady Five… it would all be the same. I would never sacrifice all twenty-four hours of my day to them as I do for you. I’d put the bare minimum amount of work in and be adamant about taking time off. I would merely perform my duties as a disciple and nothing more.</p><p>You aren’t important to me because you are an Intoner, but because you are you. And that is why I call you Lady, and always will, at least within my heart.</p><p>But I see that saying it aloud too often makes you look lonely. I love your puffy, pouty cheeks but I would never want to see you making a pained expression. So I’ve been cutting down on the number of times I pretend to have forgotten, even if it is just a trifle.</p><p>Now then, Two… no, Lady Two. Uh, what was I going to call you by next? All this internal monologuing made me forget…</p><p>"Cent?" Your eyes peer up at me curiously. What a busy pair of eyes they are… shining with laughter, glinting with anger, widening in surprise. Perhaps you are the true schemer. Artlessly, without even the use of your songs… just by moving the muscles on your face, you’ve made such a prisoner of me.</p><p>"Cent! I can tell you want to mess with my cheeks again. Well, you can’t! If you keep yanking on them, they’ll get all stretched out!"</p><p>"That is certainly not my intention. I was merely trying to stimulate them, to improve blood flow. This is an exercise to improve your complexion."</p><p>"What? Really?! Wow! Do it more, then!" …that was a fib. Forgive me, Lady Two! Your cheeks are just too soft and cute. I can’t help myself.</p><p>"Q-quit snickering! I forbid it!" Now you’ve gone all red. No matter what you say or do, you are so lovely that not just I, but all the people in our country simply adore you. Your people would do anything for you, and indeed they long to. But…</p><p>"If you continue exterminating monsters on your own like this, the troops will have no work to do."</p><p>"But I can’t let them do something so dangerous. What if they get hurt?" The soldiers wish to do all they can to protect their Intoner. Yet this is what she always says. Well, the truth is that Lady Two is capable of defeating numerous giant, blood-thirsty minotaur (albeit with my assistance). Even if they have the will to do so, none of them could do the same amount of work as she can on her own. If they are to truly be of use to her, they need to be trained to become stronger.</p><p>"This was a surprise, though. To think Minotaur would be nesting here…"</p><p>"There is a water source not far off. That’s likely the reason they chose this location."</p><p>"Right… and human roads are nearby as well." It was the western caravan that came rushing to us, panicked, saying they’d discovered a monster nest. However, as they were too flustered to speak properly, they were unable to tell us what kind of monster they had been attacked by. Even if they could speak more clearly, though, the result would have been the same, as Lady Two rushed out before they’d even finished reporting. I imagine the thought of her people being attacked by monsters did not sit well with her.</p><p>"Those Minotaur were pretty tough. One, two, three… there were seven of them in all. I had trouble concentrating since I was so worried they might hurt you, Cent."</p><p>"A wound or two would be a fair price to pay to protect you." Lady Two’s expression told me she did not agree. Of course I knew she wouldn’t.</p><p>"As you can see, however, I am without a scratch." Still, it is the duty of a disciple to put everything on the line in order to defend their Intoner in the heat of battle. If I wasn’t prepared to do that, I’d be a failure as her guardian.</p><p>"So, what should we do with these?"</p><p>"The Minotaur, you mean?"</p><p>"Even we can’t carry all seven back. I’ll take two… Cent, you can take one… yeah, three is about the most we can manage at once. So… what to do about the other four…" I knew it was pointless to suggest leaving them behind. For Lady Two, this wasn’t an option, since Minotaur meat is edible. Actually, it tastes a lot like buffalo. People in more fruitful lands might balk at the idea of eating monsters, but that’s just what we do in this desert country.Of course, there are those even here that would resist the idea of eating Gigas or Goblins. But thanks to Lady Two’s exhaustive culinary experiments, they’ve become regular fixtures on the dining table.</p><p>"Perhaps first we should move the remaining bodies back into their nest." Unlike Sand Worms, Minotaur cannot live within the sands, so they tend to build their nests within the rocks that litter the desert. They are cool and shield the beasts from sunstroke.</p><p>"They should probably hold up for half a day within the shade. In the meantime we can enlist the soldiers to come carry them back. How is that?"</p><p>"Great idea! Cent, you are soooo smart! Okay, then let’s move them, lickety-split!" Lady Two’s strong point is how quickly she acts after making up her mind. Lifting the gigantic Minotaurs as if they were as light as a feather, she indeed moved them back into their nests 'lickety-split'. I have to admit to still being impressed by the displays of her strength.</p><p>"Are you not tired at all?"</p><p>"Nope! I am A-OK! Oh, but… I’d like it if you did ‘that’ again.”</p><p>”'That'?”</p><p>"You know, massage me like you did after the time I played with the kids." Ah… 'that'.</p><p>"As you wish." A few days ago I had massaged her shoulders after she had finished playing outside with the children. Apparently she did not realize it herself, but they were very stiff.</p><p>Lady Two is in possession of muscles which quite exceed those of normal people’s. How else could she lift whole Minotaur over her head like that? If she doesn’t take care to restrain her power, she can pull doors straight off their hinges or yank banisters right out of the ground. In fact, this happens fairly often. So when she plays with the children, it requires her utmost concentration so as not to hurt them.Restraining herself in this way puts more stress on her body than fighting Minotaur in the desert would, and after a day spent frolicking with the children her shoulders and arms are tense and she is extremely fatigued. Yet Lady Two does not try to cut down on the time she spends with the little ones. No matter how busy her day gets, she strives not to neglect them. That is how important they are to her; she considers them no different than her own flesh and blood sisters. They are her family.</p><p>Should one come down with a fever or get an upset stomach, she becomes so fretful she cannot eat. I try to tell her that small children often come down with fevers or throw up their food, and that skipping meals each time to nurse them isn’t good for her health, but to no avail. Even though Lady Two understands what I tell her on an intellectual level, she’s unable to control her feelings. All that matters to her is that they recover as soon as possible.</p><p>That all I am capable of doing in such times is endeavoring to relieve her stress by even a hair is honestly a bit frustrating, but…</p><p>"All better! That felt great, Cent. Thanks!"</p><p>"You are very welcome."</p><p>"Okay! Let’s head back!" Jumping to her feet, she resembled a little rabbit or squirrel. To be honest, sometimes I worry she’ll take off running like one, never to return. Of course I realize this is a groundless fear. She would never think to disappear somewhere, abandoning the country over which she governs…</p><p>"I’m glad I got to hunt these guys down before I had to leave the country." …for she is always, always thinking first and foremost of the people under her care.</p><p>"Since pests like these inhabit the desert, I can’t afford to leave very often."</p><p>"That’s true. And it’s never sure when you might have to leave, since you must come when Lady One summons you.”</p><p>"You’re right…" Perhaps those were not the right words to say. For a moment, Lady Two’s face became clouded with the thoughts of the enemy she would soon have to face. Even with my help, there was no doubt this would be a bitter battle for her.</p><p>Ah… please, do not make such an expression. Sorrow does not suit you.</p><p>"It’s all right. What Lady One is working toward is a world in which everyone can live in peace. All the people of the world support you, their saviors, the Intoners. There is no way you’ll be defeated."</p><p>"…right! If we work hard, everyone will become happy." The shadow on her face lifted a bit.</p><p>"And I will be ever by your side. No matter what the time or place, I live to protect you, Lady Two."</p><p>"Yes… stay with me forever. Promise me you will."</p><p>"Certainly." Finally, her smile returned. Yes… that is where it should always be.</p><p>"After the battle at the Cathedral City has ended… perhaps we should take a trip together." So that your smiles will become more frequent and joyous.</p><p>"Really?! Oh, but… I’d feel bad leaving everyone else behind…"</p><p>"How about this, then? We’ll make it a journey to exterminate monsters. Soon now there will be none left in our country, so let us make it our mission to hunt down those in other lands."</p><p>"Oh, perfect! That will help everyone!" Yes, that is what I like to see. Your smile, as pure and innocent as a babe’s. I would do anything to keep that smile on your face forever. To protect that smile, I would sacrifice everything.</p><p>"But what about the kids? I can’t leave them all alone." You’re such a worry-wart, especially when it comes to the children. That’s what I love about you, though.</p><p>"Why not entrust them to Lady One? There’s nowhere safer on earth than the Cathedral City."</p><p>"That’s true!"</p><p>"If we send a few soldiers from our country to accompany them, then it surely will not be a burden on Lady One."</p><p>"I’ll ask her, then! And have her let us inspect the inside of the Cathedral, too." I’m glad. With this, the anxiety you have over the coming battle has diminished a bit, as have the clouds that hang over your heart.</p><p>"Right, then. We’ll travel from one end of the world to the next, in hunt of monsters. You did say you wanted to tour the world together, just the two of us, did you not?"</p><p>"You remembered…?"</p><p>"Even if I forget what I was talking about five minutes ago, I’ll never forget any of the precious words you’ve said to me, Lady Two." That’s right. Even should I forget everything else, your smile would remain in my mind. It alone will never fade.</p><p>”Oh! You called me Lady again!” Nor would those adorable puffy, pouty cheeks.</p><p>"That’s because we are in front of your subjects."</p><p>"We are?" I could see Lady Two’s soldiers in the distance, kicking up sand as they ran toward us. I told them she her safety was assured with me at her side and that they did not need to pursue us, but so concerned were they over their Intoner that they came chasing after us anyway. It’s not like I could blame them. I understand very well how they feel.</p><p>"Perfect timing. We’ll send them to carry back the other Minotaur."</p><p>"Great! If we get them all back now, it’ll be just in time for dinner. What to make tonight… kebabs? Or should we go all out and roast them whole?" Your expressions which change so rapidly. Each and every one is so truly dear.</p><p>"Lady Two…"</p><p>"Yes?" I just wanted to say your name, to see you turn around. No…</p><p>"Let’s go home. Please, give me your hand."</p><p>I wanted to hold your hand in my own. I’ll never let it go.</p>Ever.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Octa"><a href="#Octa" class="headerlink" title="Octa"></a>Octa</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><div class="wds-tab__content wds-is-current"><p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p><p>From <b>Drakengard 3 Official Japanese Website</b><br/>Translation by <b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131207121434/http://kho-dazat.tumblr.com/post/68052212592/all-you-need-is-joy">kho-dazat</a></b></p><p><b>Octa - <font color="red">"The Joy Of..."</font></b></p><p>I am known as Octa, disciple to the Intoner who reigns over the forest lands, Lady Three. Today I have accompanied her to the Cathedral City at the call of her elder sister, Lady One. This city is known as the birthplace of magic, and it is the bastion of both the knowledge and arts of the old world.</p><p>Of particular note is its library which holds a truly impressive assortment of texts, both new and old, from the world over. Most are written in languages I cannot understand, but there are I few I can decipher. Take this one. It reads… Diogenes Laertius? Is this an ancient history book, or perhaps a biography? I can understand the individual words but the contents are beyond me.</p><p>The next book I attempt to read to much easier to understand, not to mention considerably more interesting. It details the existence of an island nation far to the east that was known as the Land of Gold. That is, they produced so much gold that they used it to build palaces and homes. What a dazzling place it must have been! I also learned of its ancient enjoyment techniques known as The 48 Hands. Just 48? That seems a bit of a meagre number for a country known for its richness in gold. Perhaps it’s a misspelling and they truly meant The 4800 Hands? Not to brag, but I myself am the master of 666 enjoyment techniques, my proficiency in which is both a source of pride as well as my reason for living. Ho ho ho ho! Of course, even now I still practice all of them nightly. Before I’ve left this earth I’d like to increase that number to 6666. Ah, the path of self joy is a long one, indeed!</p><p>But back to the books. How about this one? It appears to be on health. No… beauty techniques. It seems it is geared toward women. Let’s see, now… it reads, how to become beautiful through pleasure? Well now, this is a subject right up my alley. Beauty concerns are of the upmost importance to any lady, and the concerns of ladies are also my own. Though Lady Three, already quite beautiful, isn’t much interested in this sort of thing.</p><p>Still, I feel I must study this book in greater detail. I, Octa, always endeavor to make use of all my skills in order to give women the deepest enjoyment. While I’m able to bring them to ecstasy in about two seconds flat, I am trying to aim for more than just speed. Instead of resting on my laurels, I want to reach higher heights. To put it more succinctly, I want to become a pleasure athlete.</p><p>To accomplish that goal, studying is of the utmost importance. They say knowledge is the mother of all virtue, and if so, it must also be the mother of enjoyment. Which would make books something like the grandmother. All paths lead to joy.</p><p>Moving on to the next book, let’s see here… it appears to be another book on health techniques. Forest Therapy is the title. Well now! This is required reading for someone who lives in a forest, like me.</p><p>Just as the name implies, the forest lands are mostly covered in thick woods. That said, it’s easy to traverse through and is really rather relaxing. It’s a nice place to indulge in some enjoyment, as well. Thanks to it being rather dark even during the day due to the shade, and the branches and bushes being good for concealment, you could carry on with any kind of pleasure you wish, be it self joy or group joy. On beautiful moonlit evenings its ideal for some night joy, as well. I can’t think of a more ideal place to enjoy the outdoors. And to think, there are therapeutic techniques to be employed while in it, as well! Truly the definition of two birds with one stone.</p><p>I must inform Lady Three of my discoveries. Lately she has been utterly obsessed with making dolls, and I’m a little concerned she is not attending to her health as she should. This is her regular routine, however. Once she becomes fixated on something she neglects to eat or even sleep. There was one occasion where she even stopped cutting her hair. By the time I realized it had grown so long it covered the entire floor of her room like a carpet, with nary a place for me to step.</p><p>Apparently ever since she was young, Lady Three has liked to cut her own hair, but since taking up doll making she’s mostly forgotten about it. While she does still enjoy playing with her scissors, it seems doll making has trumped even that in her mind. As a result, lately I have been the one trimming her hair.</p><p>On to the next book, then.</p><p>The one would appear to be on the topic of social manners. How to Be a Better Speaker… is the title. I suppose its a help manual for those who struggle in making conversation? Tips for making good first impressions, even if you’re shy… the weather and food make good general topics, but avoid the subject of politics and religion… Sure enough. Talking about the weather and food make for a decent enough icebreakers. But neither topic comes close to the connection you’d make discussing your personal enjoyments! Indeed, pleasure talk makes for the greatest social lubricant.Well, to be sure, there are some who’d be made uncomfortable by such a topic, and its never unwise to approach such subjects with a bit of care. Fortunately I find most of the soldiers under the employ of Lady Three to be open to such discussions, however. On the nights they’re up late keeping watch the conversation always seems to inevitably turn to them, perhaps to stave off sleepiness. Ho ho ho!</p><p>There are times Lady Three must lead us into battle. Since she quickly falls to sleep, I often have to find ways to entertain myself alone at the campground. Most of the time I participate in some self-joy, but occasionally I enjoy speaking with the soldiers accompanying us.I remember well the time I told them I had slept with a faerie woman. All of their eyes went as wide as dish plates when they heard me. Oh, it was quite funny indeed! Hee hee!</p><p>"B-but how?!"</p><p>"Isn’t that physically impossible?!"</p><p>"That’s beyond all reason!"</p><p>"Don’t tell me you shrunk yourself?!" It’s true that those of the faerie race are small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. In comparison, my member would seem colossal. I could understand why the soldier’s struggled with the idea.</p><p>I spied one, however, who instead of looking mystified was nodding his head as if in understanding. When the others asked him why he didn’t seem surprised, he replied in a perfectly even tone of voice:</p><p>"I just assumed he shoved the faerie up his asshole." Having said that, the wide eyes of the soldiers turned off of me and squarely onto him.</p><p>Without commenting on how accurate his assessment was, I have to say, I was quite impressed by his fluid way of thinking. I never thought I’d encounter such a like-minded person in a place like that. It was quite the happy occasion for me. Keep your thinking fluid and your member hard… that’s my personal motto.</p><p>It would be most accurate to say that I consider every hole in the world a potential lover. Whether they belong to someone of a different race like the faerie woman is hardly of any concern. What seems unnatural to me is not being able to chose a partner or use my body freely.</p><p>"Master Octa, tell us how you managed it!" All the soldiers were looking up at me with faces shining with the light of curiosity. This is how I answered:</p><p>"Clear your mind of all mundane thoughts and you will find even fire cool."</p><p>This was apparently an old religious saying from a distant eastern country, but it perfectly described my point of view. Before my ardent will to feel pleasure, trivial matters such as mere differences in size hardly acted as a deterrent. In other words:</p><p>"It’s a secret, my boys." Some things are even more exciting when left to the imagination, I find. Ho ho ho ho!</p><p>Ah, but I’ve gone on too long. I don’t often get this opportunity, so I really should continue looking through these books. This next one is… ah, it appears to be a collection of famous old sayings.</p><p>"Toil conquered the word, unrelenting toil and want that pinches when life is hard." These seem to be the words of some poet of yore. I see… If you were to replace the word toil with pleasure, I would be in perfect agreement.</p><p>"The hand is the tool of tools." Oh, now these are wise words! Truly those of a most enlightened philosopher! Surely he was one of the greatest minds of his time. Hands are indeed the greatest tool in the pursuit of pleasure. All manner of enjoyments can be had with a set of able fingers!</p><p>"Heaven doesn’t make a man better than others, nor does it make a man worse than others." This is a saying for the ages. I, too, believe heaven has made no hole better or worse than the next. All holes are equal! In other words, allowing things like age, sex, race… even species dulls your ability to truly enjoy pleasure. Each hole has its own unique features and charms. Discarding your prejudice and liberally accepting every hole with open arms is the key to a truly enriched life. Ho ho ho!</p><p>Now it’s about time to finish up my reading. Soon Lady Three will awake from her nap; or rather, it’ll be time for me to wake her. For as obsessive as she is about her interests when awake, once she falls asleep it’s nigh impossible to rouse her. I do wish I could have found a book that might have appealed to her. I think it would be healthier for her to have a variety of interests as opposed to just one obsessive one, but I also know better than to think its possible to change her nature.</p><p>Hm?! W-what is this book?!</p><p>It seems to be some sort of textbook, but on what subject? It doesn’t seem to be about math, history or science. Is it perhaps about astrology? No… but it does seem to concern stars.</p><p>Within its pages I find text detailing an enormous hole that exists far, far off in the depths of the skies above. It is described as being able to absorb anything and everything, from gigantic beasts to monstrous boulders, even mountains, continents and other stars! It sucks up all kinds of matter with ease. To me, a man who considers all the holes in the world his lovers, to learn of a hole of that dimension… how I would relish the chance to engage it! A hole that sucks in everything would be the perfect challenge for Octa, the man who loves every hole! To pursue that passion I would gladly travel to the ends of the earth and even venture into the heavens!</p><p>I must train even more devotedly for that day. To start with, I’ll engage in some special pleasures tonight with Lady Three. Exhausting every technique, I’ll bring her holes unparalleled enjoyment!</p><p>As they say, a journey of a thousand joys begins with the first step.</p><p>NOTES:Diogenes Laertius is a Greek philosopher.</p><p>Japan was once known as The Land of Gold due to the amount of gold they used to produce and export until around the Edo period, apparently. In other words, Octa is referring to Japan.</p><p>The 48 Hands are a series of sex positions, sometimes referred to as the Japanese Kama Sutra.</p><p>And here are the quotes Octa is blaspheming and who they’re attributed to:Clear your mind of all mundane thoughts and you will find even fire cool. - Words attributed to a Buddhist monk as the shrine he was in burned down around him. Toil conquered the word, unrelenting toil and want that pinches when life is hard. - VirgilThe hand is the tool of tools. - AristotleHeaven doesn’t make a man better than others, nor does it make a man worse than others. - Yukichi Fukuzawa</p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. - Lao Tzu<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

I still remember vividly the sound of her voice, the expression on her face, even the clearness of her eyes as she looked up at me. As soon as she had finished speaking, she made a face, as if she were looking at something strange. She gazed at me for a long time; I think perhaps she was still a little unsure of what a disciple was.</p><p>I, of course, understood my duty completely. It was to never leave my Intoner’s side, to serve her faithfully, to withstand the very fires of hell to protect her… the very fires of hell… fire… burning… ooh!</p><p>Uh, erm. That is to say, that was how I understood it. But I wasn’t yet sure what Lady Four’s exact expectations of me were, this being our first meeting. As a result I found myself unable to answer her at once. But Lady Four did not get angry. Instead, as if blaming herself, she continued thus:</p><p>"Oh… I’m sorry. What I meant was, would you be willing to die for an Intoner, one responsible for protecting this world? That is… could you put your life on the line for the sake of this world? I-I didn’t mean you should say you’d want to die for me personally…"</p><p>This time I answered promptly. “Yes, of course. If it is to serve you, I am ready to withstand any trial, no matter how torturous… torture… ooh!”</p><p>"Decadus? Are you all right?"</p><p>"Y-yes! I’m just fine." Lady Four shows such concern for others.</p><p>"What I can’t accomplish alone, we can surely accomplish together, as a pair… I think a disciple’s most important duty toward his Intoner is to act as a partner." Furthermore, she is incredibly intelligent and high-minded. I am proud to serve such an outstanding person.</p><p>"Ah! But don’t misunderstand me, okay? When I say partner, I don’t mean it in a weird way! I’m not the kind of person who interprets everything in only the most vulgar way… like my younger sister. Oh, but I mean…"</p><p>"Of course I will serve you in full capacity in that area as well!" Yes. To serve as the partner of an Intoner in the bedroom is another of a disciple’s duties. But is it truly all right for someone such as myself to be Lady Four’s lover? Before a personage such as herself, I am as insignificant than a stone in her path… one to be stepped on, or kicked… kicked… ooh! Kick me, please!</p><p>"I-I just said, that isn’t how I meant it! Are you s-stupid or something?! I’m different! We may be siblings, but don’t put me in the same category as my wanton, breast-obsessed little sister! I’m completely different than that girl! I think with my head… not my loins! T-that’s right! What’s important to me is your heart, not your body! Understood?!"</p><p>"Yes! Of course, my lady!" I knelt at Lady Four’s feet and earnestly begged her forgiveness for the sin of having upset her.</p><p>"Please excuse my impudence! I have not enough words to apologize to you! I will accept any punishment, however cruel, you deem fit to give me! Make it as harsh as you desire! I don’t mind if you kick me, or even whip me!" Kick me… whip me… whip… ooh!</p><p>"Now, my lady! Do not hesitate! Punish your Decadus!"</p><p>"H-hold it, raise your head off the ground! I don’t think you did anything worth being punished over…"</p><p>"No! No! I insist! To have soured your mood… I am a failure as a disciple! Punish me, please!"</p><p>"I said it was all right! I’m not going to punish you!"</p><p>"…you’re not?" You’re not going to whip me? Or even give me just a little kick? To leave me high and dry like this… it’s torturous! Wait. Torture? Oh! I get it! Lady Four, I see what you’re doing! This is your punishment! What a sublime… sublime type of torture!</p><p>"It’s okay already, so get up! Are you listening to me?" Ah… my lady! Even though this is our very first meeting, it’s as if we’ve known each other for years. For you to have grasped my desires so completely! No words could express the depth of gratitude I have for being lucky enough to serve under such an amazing Intoner like yourself!</p><p>"Could you die for me?" The second time Lady Four asked me that question was just after she’d taken control of the mountain lands, and we were setting out to exterminate monsters together.</p><p>Even after we’d dethroned the corrupt lord, the mountain lands were infested with all manner of violent, vile beasts. The many hiding spots the terrain supplied made it their ideal environment to nest in. As expected of her, Lady Four did not hesitate to set out to subdue these beasts herself in order to assuage the troubled populace. However, the soldiers serving her protested strongly. Even if the chances were one in a million, they could not bear the thought of something happening to their precious Intoner.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern. But it’s quite all right! I have the power of song, and my loyal disciple to protect me." Lady Four gave the soldiers a smile before turning to me. That’s when she repeated that question.</p><p>"Could you die for me?" I understood she had asked it in order to relieve the soldiers. As expected of my kind and considerate lady. Without hesitation, I replied:</p><p>"Of course! I will defend you with all my strength. No matter what terrible beasts assault us, I will use my own body as a shield to protect you… a shield that gets hit… and stabbed… ooh!”</p><p>"Decadus?" For a moment I thought I saw Lady Four make a troubled expression, but it must have just been because of my poor word choice. Thinking what I had said was not yet enough to put the soldiers at ease, I continued:</p><p>"To protect you, I will become anything. Even your shoes… no, the soles of your shoes, under your feet!"</p><p>"I’d prefer you didn’t." Apparently Lady Four did not wish for me to become the soles of her shoes.</p><p>On the mountain roads, monsters appeared one after the other. It was an extremely dangerous place, and the walk up to it hadn’t been easy, either. We’d been in constant danger of falling rocks and precarious cliffs the whole way; the former lord apparently had not cared a whit about making things more safe for his people.</p><p>"I’ll command the soldiers to keep things safe and clear on the paths leading in and out of the city. As it is, there’s no way the elderly or young children could traverse these roads. And to make sure no monsters get near, I’ll have to set up a constant, all-night patrol. Oh, but perhaps I’ll leave the path leading to the shrine infested… to prevent thieves and intruders." We weren’t just exterminating monsters. Lady Four was using this opportunity to survey the terrain and come up with new strategies and plans. No matter what the time or situation, her heart was always full of concern for the people. It was if she were born to lead them.</p><p>"Still…" Coming to a stop, Lady Four gave a sigh.</p><p>"I knew the prior lord was a villain, but to let things worsen to this state… how cruel!"</p><p>"Y-yes… so very… cruel… ooh!”</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"N-no. Just a slip of the tongue…" Lady Four gave me a suspicious look, but said no more. It wasn’t the time to, considering a new bunch of monsters had rushed in from the side. We assumed our battle stances.</p><p>Just as I had promised before the soldiers, I became a wall between the beasts and Lady Four. I also served as her sword, slaying many of them for her.Actually, though, I prefer not to fight with weapons. Instead I utilize my own arms and legs. As opposed to a sword or spear, when you use your own body to attack you get a better feel of just how much damage you’re inflicting upon the enemy. And also, how much damage you yourself are receiving. With each blow of my fist, the shock from the impact travels from my hands to my brain… the stronger the foe, the more clear and painful the feedback to my hands and feet. For example, were I fighting a golem with a hard, stony body… the pain my fists would receive would be… would be… ooh! Just imagining it, I… I can hardly…!</p><p>"You seem happy, Decadus."</p><p>"Using my body to protect you is my greatest pleasure, Lady Four! For your sake, I wouldn’t mind it even if I were split in two… split in… two… ooh! I can’t take it!”</p><p>"Really? It’s not the pain in your fists making you happy?"</p><p>"H-how did you…?!"</p><p>"If you want to keep things like that a secret, try not mumbling so loud!" Something in Lady Four’s voice turned very cold.</p><p>Ever since we’d returned from that mission, I got the feeling Lady Four was speaking to me less. I also felt her eyes had become harder, more chilly. Not that I was dissatisfied with that. Just the opposite, really! Oh, her gaze that seemed to pierce me like a blade made of freezing ice! Piercing me deeply… deeply… ooh! To think Lady Four could torture me so effectively without laying a single finger on me. It was almost intolerable! What a gift she had for exciting me!</p><p>Ah, but excuse me. Putting that aside, lately I’ve felt as if Lady Four is trying to avoid eye contact with me. Perhaps it is just my imagination? No… I don’t think so.</p><p>What’s important to me is your heart… that’s what Lady Four told me when I first met her. In other words, even if we do not speak… or our eyes never meet… what Lady Four desires is a disciple who can understand her heart. To be unable to do so would make me unfit to serve her.</p><p>Though I am ever at her side, Lady Four behaves as if she were alone. But this makes sense! After all, a disciple is meant to act as his Intoner’s shadow. A shadow to be stepped on… ooh… to be stepped on… Lady Four, how is it you understand me so completely? How blissful it is for me to serve such a perfect master. My joy is so great it almost scares me!</p><p>"Could you die for me?" The third time she said those words was quite recently. It had been the first time in a long while that she had spoken to me. Even if I don’t say it, you must know my life is yours. All of me exists solely for your benefit.</p><p>"Of course! For your sake, Lady Four, I would endure pain worse than death. Worse than… death… ooh!”</p><p>"…I see."</p><p>Lady Four replied curtly, before turning her back on me. I thought I heard her whisper “Just die now, then.”, but the voice in which she said it was so much lower than her usual pitch, I may have been hearing things.</p><p>Actually, it must have been the creaking of her bedroom door I heard instead. It’s a very, very old door. Tomorrow, after Lady Four awakens, I’ll have to take the time to grease its hinges.</p><p>After the door had closed with a loud creak, I silently bowed in its direction.</p><p>"Good night, my lady. Sleep well…" Then, as I did every night, I sat before the door to keep watch.</p><p>In addition to being old and noisy, my lady’s bedroom door did not do much to muffle the sounds from within. To be frank… I could easily hear everything going on inside it, especially as the night grew later and more still.</p><p>As I sat on my knees before that door, I often hear the sounds of the bed frame creaking and my lady panting. It does make me feel a bit guilty, especially whenever I hear her call out sweetly for her older sister in her sleep.</p><p>There are those amongst the soldiers who spread rude rumors that she’s trying to be seductive, offering herself up to me… but that is incorrect! Completely and utterly!</p><p>To have me sit and listen before that door… to even leave it unlocked as she does… none of that suggests seduction. She could take me into her room at any time, which is exactly why she leaves me out of it. Furthermore, she makes me sit upright on the cold floor… which, as my legs grow ever more numb… the sounds of her voice crying out and the rustling of clothing enters my ears…</p><p>What perfect… artful teasing! What perfect… masterful torture!</p><p>Just after I had first begun to serve her, I often imagined being smashed under her cold heels, or being torn up by her long, sharp nails… but now I realize how shallow those fantasies were.</p><p>I don’t require the feel of her heels or nails. Between Lady Four and I, there is no need for physical contact. Lady Four bestows upon me joyful pain enough without it. This is what she meant by being partners! We are truly connected, heart-to-heart!</p><p>Without ever touching her person, or even my own… no, exactly because we do not touch, these maddening pleasures continue indefinitely! Outside of her door, teased by my growing lust, I am earnestly tortured… earnestly ignored… all throughout the night. I wish time could stop, that dawn might never come, so that this could continue eternally. Oooooh!</p><p>Just imagining it, I… I can hardly… oooooh!</p><p>What… what… torture! What extreme torture! No… no… this is a reward! Being left here, cruelly neglected… that itself is my reward!</p>Ah! Could there be anything more pleasurable?!<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

It annoys me, but this being a seaside country, there’s no getting away from it, save for sleep. Another morning... I think wearily to myself. I wish the sun had never risen. Then I wouldn’t have to go through another exasperating day... but no. If the sun had never rose, it would still be night. Nights are worse.... because at nights, I have to...</p><p>I stop thinking before the bad memories fully came back to me. But just the hint of them made my whole body shudder. That’s when I heard her voice.</p><p>“Dito?” The same voice as in the memories I was trying to avoid. I should have tried to feign sleep a little longer... this woman is as dense as a brick, yet surprisingly sensitive to my movements. This... sow-like woman.</p><p>“Hmm? Five... up already?” I make a show of rubbing my eyes as if I’d only just woken up.</p><p>“Dito, continue sleeping.” Ah, if I could, I would! I’d actually prefer never to wake up again, if it meant one less night of those huge bags of meat suffocating me...</p><p>“It’s because you’re being so noisy, Five.” Still, I can’t let my guard down. Who knows what she’d try to do to my defenseless body... not that things go much better when I’m conscious.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It’s okay...” Like hell she’s sorry. She’s not really. She’s only pretending to be considerate. It’s all surface-level with her.</p><p>“Going through your wardrobe again? This early in the morning?”</p><p>“There’s not enough time in the day for me! I’ve got to get as early a start as possible.”</p><p>“Well, maybe if you didn’t change your clothes three or four times in one day you’d have more time. Couldn’t you just wear one outfit until evening?” Besides, there’s no masking your insides. No matter what you wear, you’re still jump a fat lump of flesh. Wrap yourself up in ribbons all you like... in the end a pig is still a pig.</p><p>“I can’t do that! How could I wear just one dress when I have so many?!” It’s almost sort of tragic how someone could have so much to wear yet so little that actually suited them. Strike that... it’s hilarious.</p><p>“Tell me, Dito, what about these?” I can tell you already they won’t look good. Don’t you realize those layered gowns just make you look even meatier? Or that those woolen ones make you seem twice as fat? I’ll bet you haven’t the foggiest idea that your favorite style of clothing, with all the lace and frills, looks worst on you. Like a ham wrapped up as a gift. Talk about bad taste.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t like any of these dresses because they seem hard to take off me?” That’s not it at all! Ugh, you’re so gross! Don’t touch me!...I want to scream, but of course I can’t. No upsetting the Intoner, now. I am her loyal disciple... I must act in a way that pleases her.</p><p>“No... that’s not what...” This is what you like, right? Me acting like a cute little boy, blushing and shy?</p><p>“Or maybe you’d prefer I wore nothing at all...”</p><p>“I-I...” Of course I wouldn’t! Why would I?!</p><p>“I don’t mind doing it clothed, either...”</p><p>“But...” Whether you’re naked or clothed, I don’t want to do it with a pig!</p><p>“I just need to be on top in that case. Or we could do it standing, from behind...”</p><p>“I said I don’t...!” I don’t want to have sex with you! The position isn't the issue here!</p><p>“There’s no need to be shy...” Believe me, I’m not. I’m rejecting you from the bottom of my heart! ...I could never say that. Not as long as I’m her disciple.</p><p>“Dresses! Weren’t we picking out dresses?!” Face as red as an apple, I act flustered. The tone of my voice has become high-pitched as I indicate toward the dresses. So you enjoy this kind of behavior, huh? You hag.</p><p>“How about this one? This middle one, here? It’s dazzling!”</p><p>“Forget the dresses for now, Dito. Come here...”</p><p>“Well, then, how about this one? Check out the detail on this embroidery! You haven’t worn this one yet, have you?” I slip out of her arms, though I know my escape will be short-lived. She likes it when I play hard-to-get, anyway. It’s more exciting for her if her prey tries to get away. Entering her dressing room, I let out a big sigh. The other disciples must have the patience of saints! That or their Intoners are considerably more sane. Maybe they all just have it better than me.</p><p>Those two lovebirds from the desert kingdom seem pretty happy. It’s like they’re walking through a perpetual flower field. It’s embarrassing to watch. A disciple’s duty is to satisfy the sexual needs of his Intoner. What’s the point of acting like you’re in love? What kind of freak would fall in love with an Intoner in the first place? Oh, but right... that disciple is a total idiot. No wonder, then. A waste, though, to be so handsome and yet so dumb. I wonder what’s harder, being ugly and intelligent or handsome and dumb? In any case, god seems to be stingy when it comes to giving out good looks and smarts at the same time.</p><p>I continue pretending I’m looking for a dress. I make some noise pulling and pushing things off the rack, lest the pig woman check in on me. I’m careful not to tear any fabric, though. Thinking she might get sick of hearing the same sounds, I pull one of her gaudier dresses inside out, but soon realize how pointless what I’m doing is and give up on it. Instead I study the inside-out dress. Its shiny fabric can’t be seen through the back, and the reversed stitching reminds me of veins. It’s much prettier this way.</p><p>I sort of like things inside-out like this. I wish you could do the same thing to humans; just stick your hands down their throats and yank them clean inside-out. Then all their organs and stuff would be right on display. Imagine if they were still digesting? Then you could see all the food they’d eaten right there in their stomachs. That’d be one heck of a sight. Even that pig woman, if you turned her inside out... she might be cuter then. Instead of the white of her skin, imagine seeing the red and pink of her facial muscles. And her entrails, dangling invitingly... that’d be pretty sexy. I wonder how a moan might sound from an inside-out throat?</p><p>...I’m getting kind of hot and bothered.</p><p>Time to stop daydreaming. Got to head back into the thick of it sooner or later. Searching for a dress was just a desperate bid to save time. My fate can’t be avoided. Carrying a dress she’d bought recently from an eastern salesman, I leave the dressing room. This Intoner likes nothing better than a performance, and the sight of me as her clown. She’s got to have some screws loose, alright... but all the same. As I expected, her expression is one of satisfaction. I wish she’d learn to smile a little less vulgarly.</p><p>“This dress is lovely, too. But so is this one! Oh, I’m at such a loss...” I’m the one at a loss here. It’s tough watching a woman be so engaged in picking out clothes that don’t suit her. Pretty depressing.</p><p>“I wish I had three or four bodies. Then I could wear these all at once!”</p><p>“Three or four of you?! Are you serious?!”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“...that would be a nightmare!” I couldn’t help but blurt out my true thoughts. Three or four of her?! That would herald the end of days. I’d sooner hang myself.</p><p>“I think it’s a splendid idea. Next time I see my sister One, I’ll ask her if she doesn’t know a spell that could do that.” Does that mean we’ll have to go see her soon? Man. The eldest Intoner has a sharp mind. She makes me nervous... I’ve only met her a few times, but something about her rubs me the wrong way. After all, she was the one to command meatball here to rule over this seaside land. Can’t thank her enough for that, now can I...</p><p>“If there were three of me, I wouldn’t have to worry about what to wear. I could eat three times my full, as well!”</p><p>“You already eat enough for three people as it is.”</p><p>“Oh, I do not!” Oh yes, you do! Make it more like five or six. She eats so much I’m surprised the chefs here haven’t died of exhaustion yet!</p><p>“When the cooks ask if you’d prefer meat or fish for dinner, you always say both.”</p><p>“Okay, my dear Dito. That’s still only two people’s worth.”</p><p>“Then when they ask how you’d like your meat prepared, roasted or sautéed or boiled, you say all three!”</p><p>“Well, when you put it like that...”</p><p>“And then when they’d ask how you’d like your fish, grilled or baked or fried...?”</p><p>“I suppose I ask them to prepare all three. Oh no, now I’m hungry. Is breakfast ready yet?”</p><p>“Five, your gluttony knows no bounds...” If I could, I’d ask her smart older sister for a spell to diminish her appetite.</p><p>“I can’t wait for spring. Then I can go searching for scrumptious new things.” Hunting and foraging was a hobby of hers. But scrumptious is not the word I would use to describe what she brings back...</p><p>“You mean things not fit for human consumption.”</p><p>“Oh, but Two cooks them wonderfully! She has a knack for making delicious meals out of them.”</p><p>“You don’t deny that they’re usually inedible, though.” How could she? Stuff like troll, orc and goblin meat... even sandworms. That’s called monster hunting, not ingredient gathering.</p><p>“Two makes goblin brain into a delicious pate. Then there’s her spiky lizard stew, and her pickled six-eyed monster fish...” No sane person would eat any of that crap. Never mind their twisted libidos, there’s also something seriously wrong with the Intoner taste buds, too.</p><p>“I guess you could consider it gourmet eating?”</p><p>“You think so?”</p><p>“Sure, dining on food you risked your life procuring could be a whole new culinary trend. I’ll pass on it, though...” My measured response was due to my Intoner’s influence. I really wanted to ask her what kind of animal would ever consider eating the crap she was describing.</p><p>As I was thinking that, my eyes were forced back on her. I hate it when she makes me do that.</p><p>“Um... Five?” I could feel my face going slack as I looked up at the pig woman.</p><p>“What are you thinking right now...? Something strange...?” Like I needed to ask. I’d know that lustful expression from a mile away.</p><p>“Not at all...” Yeah, right. Sex is all you think about.</p><p>“H-how about breakfast? You’re hungry, right?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m going to dig in right now...”</p><p>“Five! Wait-” Aren’t I a tragic hero? Forced to act in this charade?</p><p>“No, I won’t wait... not anymore...” It’s in an Intoner's nature to be perverted and lewd. Perhaps it’s connected to their singing abilities. As if that makes any sense at all... How can I sympathize with a nymphomaniac who gives me no peace, day or night? I can’t. No matter what the circumstances may be.</p><p>“Why are we doing this first thing in the morning...?” I’m annoyed by my own complaining. I should know there’s no point. I almost want to knock my own mouth shut!</p><p>“Because of your cute, sleepy little face...”</p><p>“That makes no sense.”</p><p>“Don’t you like sleeping with my big breasts as a pillow?” Ahhh... I give up.</p><p>I wish she would at least stop licking me all over like that. It makes me feel all gross and sticky. It’s the worst. She’s got no technique, either. The smell of her saliva, her body fluids... I want to throw up. I wish I could... I’d feel better for it. But that her anger her, for sure. Her voice is what I really can’t stand. Sounds like someone strangling a chicken. This is the pits. My body is all sticky, my ears full of that awful sound, and those two sacks grinding against my stomach as she writhes on me... I can’t think of a worse torture than this. I wonder if that old man with the rings wouldn’t switch with me. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind being this woman’s partner... seems like he’ll do anything with a hole. There’s probably no man more suited toward being a disciple than that one. I’d like a spell to make three or four of him. Hey, that’s not a bad idea. I’ll ask big sis One about it myself, next time I see her...</p><p>God, when are you going to be done?! You’re so heavy. Get off already, you hag! I wish I could kill you! There’s no way I could though. I’ve already tried to. But when I went to stab her from behind...</p><p>”What are you doing, Dito? Naughty boy.” The moment I heard her voice, my sword was at my feet. My hands had lost the strength to grip it. No disciple can defy their Intoner. No matter what. I learned the truth that day... just remembering what happened makes me want to die. I want to die.</p><p>Why did I have to be her disciple? Why couldn’t I have gotten a different Intoner? I’d have liked to serve under another one instead. But maybe they’re all the same... who knows? Still, no one could be worse than her. Those two in the desert seem happy, the old man is having fun... it’s not fair that only I have to suffer. Hm? Speaking of which, wasn’t there another one of us... the idiot, the old man, me, and... ugh, I forgot. Oh well.</p><p>I wish she’d finish already. I’ve already counted all the cracks in the ceiling. I really don’t want to have to get started on the walls...</p><p>“No... not yet...!” Not yet what? It’s all the same in the end, no matter how many hours you’re at it. It’s not like you feel anything. To be so lustful yet unable to feel a thing... on that count alone, I pity you. Poor thing... nah, you deserve it.</p><p>“My dear, sweet Dito... don’t make that face.” What face? Am I making a face? Whatever it is, it must be to your liking.</p><p>“If your appetite is as much as three people’s, Five, your lust is equal to thirty.”</p><p>“My... what praise!”</p><p>“I’m not praising you...”</p><p>“Good boy... let me reward you. Where do you want it next?”</p><p>“That’s a punishment, not a reward.”</p><p>“Oh? You prefer to be punished?” Not really, but it’s all the same in the end. This is torture.</p><p>“Why are you so lustful, Five?”</p><p>“Am I? Really?” You don’t even realize it? Well, I suppose it’s more than a simple case of lust for you...</p><p>An Intoner’s libido is stronger than a normal human’s. But you’re even more different. No matter how many positions you try or how many hours you spend doing it, it will never feel good for you. Do you think sleeping with lots of people will fix that? You’re not satisfied with your dressed because none of them suit you. Do you think new ones will change that? You know that no one would serve you if you didn’t brainwash them. Do you think you’ll ever find someone who honestly loves you?</p><p>Unfortunately there is no cure for your lack of sensation. No dress will ever look good on you and nobody on earth is crazy enough to love you. My poor little Intoner... serves you right! ...hm? I feel a crease in my brow. Am I frowning? I touch my forehead, cheeks and mouth. I’m frowning all right. But how? Five would never allow me to frown...</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>“It’s not like you to space out in bed like that.” I’m a little shocked, to be honest. But Five quickly regains her composure. Before I know it, she’s back to her gluttonous old self. I can tell because my voice and facial muscles are going out of my control, just as usual.</p><p>“Don’t be mean... I have matters on my mind, as well.”</p><p>“Are you mad?”</p><p>“No...” You’re lying. You must be, or else why is my voice coming out so soft? Why is my face contorted in fear? Are you mad I interrupted your reverie? Or that I noticed you were distracted? Disciples cannot disobey their Intoners. That’s right... I can’t raise so much as a finger against this woman. I am made to act the way she pleases, to say words that delight her. I am a perfect slave.</p><p>I remember you once said this to your kind elder sister: ”I love this boy with all my heart. Every last bit of him! Even his mean and mischievous parts.”Who wouldn’t love a boy who’d do anything they wanted? You like the mean and mischievous parts of me? Please. You regulate just how mean I am, and never allow it to surpass your expectations. Any part of me that doesn’t fall in line with your image of me, you suppress. The proof of that is in my inability to utter a single word of truth to you, even now.</p><p>“Let’s continue...”</p><p>“You’re not done yet?!” I’m not really surprised. I’m just being made to act like I am. My eyes become wide on their own; I didn’t will them to. I just lay back and let it happen.</p><p>“Just kidding...” I know you are. I know all of you, after all; your lies, your emptiness, your stubbornness, your desire for control. And you know, I don’t hate the ugliness inside your heart. I can forgive your rotting insides, because...</p>I’m your disciple.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

With my keen eyesight, I could tell that every last smile was a genuine one. Yes… I could see clearly the sparkle in their eyes, the laughter pouring from their lips… not a single person wore a troubled or forced expression.</p><p>Why should they? The scourge of the tyrants lord had been eliminated, the nobility that fostered them dismantled. The people had at last been released from their torment. How long they had prayed for this day to come!</p><p>The only person struggling not to frown was me. It was all I could do to keep from covering my ears and falling to my knees… despite my being an Intoner.For a moment I wished I had my sisters with me, but I shook those thoughts from my head. While having all five of us situated in the capital would surely be heartening to the citizens, it would not make sense to have them abandon the posts which I had only just assigned them to. It wouldn’t be long before I had to call them here in any case. Not much time remained before the ‘day of promise’.</p><p>Facing the people crowding the streets, I gave a wave from atop my steed. This caused them to cheer even louder, and I felt the animal tense beneath me. I am not fond of horses due to their strong odor, but in this case I could sympathize with the beast. We were both being forced to parade our way from the harbor towards the cathedral. I would have preferred to have snuck back after sunset; I wanted to be alone. My mind, exhausted from battle, sorely needed a rest. But I was not allowed to be so selfish. It was my duty as an Intoner to symbolize order and peace having returned to the world, even if that meant being made a spectacle of. And how could the innocent people know that their cries of elation were causing me, with my heightened senses, to feel as if my head were being split in two?</p><p>January 27th</p><p>In the days following my return to the capital, I’ve been poring earnestly over the books in the cathedral library. I quite like it in here; the thick tomes muffle sounds from the outside, making it comfortably quiet. And while the smell of dust and must troubles my nose, it is nothing compared my usually having to take in the body odor of humans and animals.</p><p>That’s right… it’s not just my eyesight and hearing that are pronounced. All five of my senses, including taste, touch and smell are torturously sensitive. It wasn’t as bad when I was a child. Back then my senses were only slightly enhanced. But as I grew so did they, at a pace that far outstripped my physical development. Before long sounds and smells seemed to be assaulting me. I could no longer enjoy the taste of food due to it being too intense. Even the touch of my own clothes upon my skin made me feel deeply uncomfortably… those days before I developed a method of coping were very hard, and weighed heavily on my psyche. But all of us Intoners have one bodily aspect which develops excessively compared to the rest, as a side-effect of our strength. Perhaps it’s silly to expect that those as powerful as ourselves could hope to otherwise live normally.</p><p>I heard footsteps approaching. There were two pairs, one leading, the other following. They suddenly came to a stop, however, and seemed to hesitate for a moment before beginning to walk on tip-toes. Soon I heard a gentle knock at the door. From her thoughtful behavior, I could already guess who it was; my energetic yet very gentle younger sister, Two.</p><p>"It’s open. You made it here quickly, Two…" As soon as I had called her name, the door made a terrible sound and I heard her give a little shriek.</p><p>"I-I’m sorry…! I broke it…" Two stood in the doorway, eyes full of tears. In her hand she still gripped the doorknob, the door ripped off its hinges still attached. Just as my senses were overdeveloped, so too were Two’s muscles. While she looked quite slight, her arms and legs held the strength of ten men. It was easy for her to break things or hurt people, so Two usually took great care to restrain her movements. That this had happened in spite of her vigilance meant that her strength must have suddenly increased without her realizing.</p><p>At least her growth did not affect her appearance. Our sister Three’s hair grows at an incredible rate, so much so that she must constantly be cutting it. As a result she travels with a pair of scissors wherever she goes. Then there is Four and her nails; unlike hair which at least doesn’t hurt when it is cut, Four is constantly suffering from her nails splitting and breaking. She long had a habit of biting them to keep them down, and struggled greatly to stop doing it. The subject is still a sensitive one for her, and it’s sad to see her always trying to hide her hands. Our youngest sister Five is just the opposite, taking inordinate pride in her ever expanding bust. Four would always be muttering that such large breasts on one so young was vulgar and disturbing, but I wonder if she wasn’t also jealous, if not of Five’s chest than of her bravado. Seeing Five take such pride in her assets must be very frustrating for her.</p><p>"One, what should I do…?" Two’s voice brought me back to the present.</p><p>"Don’t be concerned. It was a very old door, already ready to come off its hinges. I’ll have someone fix it."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Really." Two’s smile returned in an instant. Her guileless nature remained unchanged from childhood.</p><p>"Well! It’s nice to see you, Sis! I hope you’ve been well. It’s been such a long time…" Actually, it hadn’t. Not much time had passed since we’d suppressed a noble uprising together with her disciple.</p><p>"…ha ha. I guess it’s only felt like a long time, hasn’t it, Cent?" The man beside her nodded. He had a habit of running flipping his jet black hair that struck me as looking very affected, but Two didn’t seem to mind. In fact, she was completely taken in by her him, her disciple. Yes… every Intoner must have a disciple, who lives to serve and protect her.</p><p>"Are we the first ones here?" When I told her yes, Two’s eyes lit up.</p><p>"You hear that, Cent? We made it first! Isn’t that great?"</p><p>"Why, you always come first in my eyes, Lady Two…"</p><p>"Aww, Cent… you come first to me, too! I love you most in the whole wide world!" Two proclaimed with blushing cheeks. This was the way these two usually carried on. While it could be embarrassing to watch, I felt an Intoner and her disciple being linked by a strong bond of love was ideal.</p><p>…that said, if I left them undisturbed for too long they’d start getting overly affectionate, so I cut in.</p><p>"How do things fare in the Desert Country?"</p><p>"O-oh yeah! There was this huge minotaur nest, but we got rid of it!"</p><p>I’d meant how the nobility there were handling having been stripped of their privilege and whether she had reason to believe they were plotting something, but instead Two briefed me on her hunting monsters, offering shelter to misplaced people and maintaining a steady food supply.Well, I suppose if this was all she had to discuss it was safe to assume there wasn’t anything to worry about. The Desert Country is made up of just that, lifeless desert. Very little can be grown there and the lives of the people are hard. I had given Two the task of governing with the hopes she could lift their spirits with her optimistic nature. Having heard that she was well-loved by her people, with the soldiers in her employ ready to lay down their lives for her, I realized my judgement had not been mistaken.</p><p>"Say, would you mind if Cent and I inspected the cathedral to make sure it’s safe while we’re here? I’m sure you don’t." Before I could reply Two had already turned on her heel. I remembered she had wanted to do the same thing when she was here a half year ago, but didn’t have the time to. I suppose she wouldn’t let the opportunity escape her now. It really impressed me, how little her character had changed over the years. Her disciple gave me a bow before following her out, and I returned to my books.</p><p>The reason I was holed up in here wasn’t just because it was quiet. I was looking for something. I don’t know who gathered them, but this library was full of books from all over the world; one of them must hold the information I seek. I wanted an answer to my dearest question: What are the Intoners, and why do they exist?</p><p>February 14th</p><p>My sister Four and her disciple Decad arrived much sooner than I’d expected, given the Mountain Country is furthest from the capital.</p><p>"I invited Three to travel with us, but she was so busy with her dolls she turned us down." Four said with an exaggerated sigh. The Forest Country Three presided over neighbored Four’s domain.</p><p>"That’s just her way. Don’t take it personally." Rather than having been turned down, it was more likely Four had been flat-out ignored. Three was the strangest of us sisters, with a love of dolls stemming back from childhood. Once she became focused on making her own no one’s words could reach her. She even forget to eat and sleep; she probably hadn’t even noticed Four was there.</p><p>"More importantly…"</p><p>"You’d like a report on my country, correct?"</p><p>"You are quick on the uptake as always, Four." Four’s expression beamed with pride, and she began to brief me on the status of the Mountain Country.</p><p>"Everything is going smoothly. I mean, how could it not? The population isn’t that large and the livable portion of land is rather compact. The former lord must have been a true dim-wit to make such a mess of things." That was correct. If the Mountain Country hadn’t been so easy to govern, I’d never have entrusted it to Four. Four is serious and intelligent, but rather immature. Faced with difficulty, she either recedes into her shell or spectacularly loses her temper. There was no way I could rely on her to deal with anything potentially overwhelming.</p><p>"It’s not the Mountain Country that worries me. Tell me about the Forest Country?" There was a reason behind Four’s visit to Three, and that was because I had requested she go take stock of Three’s land on her way here. Truthfully, I’d been worried; assigning Three to govern there had been a gamble on my part.</p><p>"Surprisingly, she seems to be managing well! It’s enough to make me re-evaluate my opinion of her. I can’t imagine having to deal with those awful Faeries or those snobby elves." The majority of the people residing in the forest were not human. It was home to faeries and secluded elf villages. But that’s exactly why I thought Three would fare best there.</p><p>Non-humans generally do not take well to humans encroaching on them. The key to co-existence with them is to give them ample space to themselves. The previous lord had tried instead to exert control over them, which hadn’t gone well. Three, who had no drive, would not make the same mistake.Also, it was a load off my mind having her in a place where not many had to deal with her. The fewer, the better…</p><p>"One?"</p><p>"Ah. Excuse me, it’s nothing. Go on."</p><p>"That’s all there is to say! There are no problems in either my country or Three’s. With the wicked lords gone, the people lead happy lives. This past harvest was the first they’d ever have in which the fruits of their labor were not immediately robbed from their hands."</p><p>"That’s good to hear. Thank you." But though she had just told me there was no more to say, Four lingered.</p><p>"What is it?" I could clearly tell she had something she wanted to tell me.</p><p>"Are we really… going to fight her?"</p><p>"That’s why I called for you all." I said firmly, but Four continued, albeit timidly.</p><p>"I don’t see any point in such a battle…"</p><p>"Then you’d have us all killed?"</p><p>"No… of course not!"</p><p>"But that’s what not fighting would mean." Four cast her eyes downward dejectedly.</p><p>"One… you’ve changed…"</p><p>"I don’t doubt it. But so have we all." Of course we had. We were no longer children. We had to change, if only to keep a hold on our Intoner powers which grew in strength each day. I’ve forgotten, now… how old were we when we realized something was wrong with our bodies?</p><p>Why do we possess this power? To maintain the order of the world; I’d known this since I was a child. But how did I know it? Who taught that to me?Four looked unsatisfied, but silently took her leave. Her disciple, Decad, followed after her like a shadow. Their eyes had not met once the entire time they were in the room. Perhaps Four disliked having an older, mild-mannered man as her disciple. In comparison to Two, she was quite cold. But I noticed that Decad himself did not seem to mind her treatment. It could be that in itself frustrated Four even more.</p><p>As soon as I could no longer hear the sound of their steps, I resumed my reading. I had not once let up on my research, yet I’d still been unable to find a scrap of information on Intoners… or disciples, for that matter. Perhaps my way of looking had been flawed. It could be that we were not always referred to as Intoners, but by another name. But there is no way existences as powerful as we would not be recorded. Take our songs, for instance. They were nothing like the usual practice of chanting words to cast magic, and sure to peak the interest to a wizard. Yet none of the tomes on sorcery made any mention of us.</p><p>Why can’t I find anything? Was the existence of Intoners being purposefully omitted? Had someone wished to censor any mention of us? If so, why?</p><p>February 22nd</p><p>"Two told me Three isn’t here yet. And here I was sure we’d be the last to arrive!" Five said, tilting her head to the side. I wasn’t surprised. I knew the last one here would either be Three or Five; Three due to being wrapped up in her doll-making and Five due to surely putting off her departure until the last minute on account of her domain being closest to mine.</p><p>"That’s why I told you we didn’t need to hurry!" Said Five’s disciple. As long as he kept his mouth shut, he was a boy of astounding beauty, but as soon as it opened it was all for naught. I believe Four once dubbed him a cheeky little brat. I was of a similar opinion.</p><p>"Five, you never listen to a word I say!"</p><p>"Why, that’s just not true."</p><p>"It is so. Take last night, for instance. I kept telling you I was tired, and you still-" I cleared my throat, not caring to hear anymore of what the disciple was going to say.</p><p>"Let’s keep things short. How are things in the Ocean Country?" Of all the territories, the corrupt lords had the tightest grip on the Ocean Country. Most of the rich and influential nobles resided there, and those who remained hated us intensely for robbing them of what they considered rightly theirs. Of course, their wealth had never truly belonged to them; they had robbed it from the people. We had merely returned it to its rightful owners.</p><p>In any case, of all the places a potential uprising might occur, the Ocean Country ranked first. I had feared governing it would prove difficult for Five, but apparently my fears were unfounded.</p><p>"You needn’t fret. I’ve long since made all those naughty nobles my slaves." Five said with a giggle and a wink.</p><p>"Five has to own people body and soul, after all…" Her disciple said with a grimace.</p><p>Ever since she was small, Five couldn’t stand not getting what she wanted. As a result, she’d grown quite forceful about obtaining things. Be it an object or a person, Five would not rest until they were hers completely. This greediness often repelled others, but it seemed to be serving her well in regards to taking control over the entire country.</p><p>"And how goes the reconstruction of the harbors?" During our battle with the lord there, we had accidentally laid waste to most of the seafront. It was difficult to keep our powers in check while fighting, even though he tried to be careful. That was just how strong we had grown.</p><p>"Well. Trading ships from the East have begun coming into port."</p><p>"And that made Five very happy. She exchanged all her diamonds for what the Eastern merchants had to sell." The previous lord had been a woman, and her castle was full of extravagant dresses and jewels which Five quickly claimed for herself. While they ought have gone to the people, I let Five do as she pleased because I was also well aware of her tendency of growing bored with things. No matter how driven she might have been in pursuing something, her satisfaction upon obtaining it was never long-lived and soon she’d discard it.</p><p>True to form, Five had grown tired of the treasures within the castle and had deemed to replace them with something new. And she’d repeat this process time and time again, I was sure. But now her fickleness would stimulate the country’s trade.</p><p>Output was low in the Ocean Country as it did not have many natural resources. There was a fishing industry, but that was not enough to support all the people in there. Only through commerce and trade could it prosper.</p><p>"Not just the gems, I sold all the dresses, too. The busts on them had grown too tight for me, after all. My bountiful bosom still seems to be growing." I saw Five’s disciple give his shoulders a distasteful shrug at her words. On his face was a spiteful grin that was much at odds with the rest of his delicate features.</p><p>"Say that in front of Four and she’ll have your head!" He warned Five, which I found ironic considering how he himself said things to anger Four just as frequently. I didn’t see the point in voicing this, however.</p><p>Two’s muscles had grown stronger. Four had been wearing gauntlets which hid her hands, but going by the incessant clacking of her clippers, I could surmise her nails were growing as fast as ever. Of course I was painfully aware of my ever sharpening senses; even here in the library as I was beginning to be able to pick up sounds from the outside. And here Five was telling me her cup size had increased yet again. Would these twisted transformations continue to increase alongside our powers? As a child I had prayed for strength… yet now I feared how strong we might become.</p><p>"I understand. Thank you for your report."</p><p>Saying I had work to return to, I turned my back on them. I wasn’t lying; I was eager to return to my search. Even after all the reading I’d done, I’d yet to find anything remotely relating to Intoners. It was beginning to make me very nervous. Fearing I may find nothing in the end, I flipped through the book pages at a harried pace.</p><p>March 3rd</p><p>Three arrived exactly on the ‘day of promise’.</p><p>Deeply frustrated by the fruitlessness of my research, I had been in the library since the crack of dawn, surrounded by texts. Before I registered her footsteps I heard the sound of her scissors snipping. Behind her lazy footfalls sounded the even pace of her disciple Octa.</p><p>"What has two legs in the morning, twelve in the afternoon, and one in the evening…" The door creaked open and I was met by Three’s questioning face.</p><p>"…can you guess?"</p><p>"You’re late." Was my only reply. There was little point in trying to figure out Three’s riddles as they were mostly meaningless. As a child Three had been very quiet, but since she’d become obsessed with dolls she’d become much more chatty, perhaps as a result of talking to them.</p><p>"…has your hair stopped growing?" It had taken me a moment to notice on account of her awful posture, but I realized Three’s hair, which usually hung at her waist, was cut short at her shoulders.</p><p>"Oh, no. It’s that I’ve been taking care of my lady’s hair as of late." Said Octa with a laugh. That explained it looking neater than usual. At first glance, Octa seemed a friendly if somewhat eccentric old man. Unfortunately, eccentric didn’t begin to cover him…</p><p>"I see." So it was still growing at the usual rate. Of course it was. Why would Three be an exception?</p><p>There was a time in which we needed all the strength we could muster. But after the battle today, what use will our power be? What’s the point of it increasing?</p><p>"…I’m tired." Three yawned. When not working on her dolls she was extremely lethargic, and these words always preceded her lying on the spot, regardless of her location, to sleep.</p><p>"Don’t lay on those books. They’re antiques, you’ll damage them." Three, about to stretch out of a pile of old books, managed to just barely avoid them and lay on the cold floor beside them.</p><p>"Why don’t you rest in one of the bedrooms?" Traveling from the Forest Country took nearly as long as the journey from the Mountain Country. Surely both she and her disciple were exhausted, and we had nothing to discuss since I’d already heard about the state of her land from Four.</p><p>"What’s the matter?" I’d expected her to either fall asleep there or leave, but Three did neither. Instead she was playing with her scissors, expressionless. I could never tell what she was thinking, and I had a feeling her disciple couldn’t, either.</p><p>And yet… sometimes I was struck by the feeling that perhaps my strange sister knew more than I did. Perhaps she had already long ago grasped the answer to the question I was searching for so desperately…</p><p>"I won’t sleep."</p><p>"But you said you were tired."</p><p>"…white." Her inability to hold a normal conversation was also nothing knew. I turned to Octa.</p><p>"I have work to attend to. If you wouldn’t mind taking her…"</p><p>"But of course, my la-"</p><p>"Atop the leviathan, its scales whiter than snow, a pink blade." Three cut off her disciple with another riddle.</p><p>"Three…?"</p><p>"Where does the tip of that blade point? …can you guess?" Three’s eyes stared straight into mine. She was no longer talking nonsense; I grasped the meaning of her words. The leviathan with scales whiter than snow… a white dragon, who carried on its back a woman with pink eyes. A woman who pointed her blade toward us… her sisters.</p><p>On her way here, Three must have caught sight of the enemy we were to fight this day, as had been promised.</p><p>"I suppose I’m out of time." I sighed.</p><p>In the end, I couldn’t find any mention of Intoners, our songs, our disciples… nothing. My search had been pointless.</p><p>"Who is right? Is it you, One? Is it Two… Four… Five? Or… could it actually be Zero?" Three asked with no hint of a smile.</p><p>"…all people believe that they are the ones who are right." Or else, how could they fight? No one was strong enough to dedicate themselves to a cause they knew was mistaken. They had to justify it somehow first. My search for an answer had been an attempt to justify my reason for fighting my sister today. Did that mean I doubted myself, my decisions?</p><p>"One?" Feeling Three’s dubious gaze, I realized I’d been laughing.</p><p>It didn’t matter whether I had an answer, a justification. Whether I knew what we were or why we existed wouldn’t change what I needed to do. I would fight this battle all the same. So what need did I have for doubt?</p><p>I closed the book I had been reading and rose from my seat. In the distance I heard the roar of a dragon. There was no mistaking it. The traitor was upon us.</p><p>"Let us meet her head on. Today we fulfill the promise we made."</p><table class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" data-expandtext="show" data-collapsetext="hide" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; text-align: center; margin-top:

But he leaves out the “Lady” part when we’re all alone. We made that promise a while ago. That’s why Cent’s been calling me "Two" lately. As long as we're alone.</p><p>But he said “Lady” just now. That means...</p><p>I stop pouring water into the cooking pot and about-face! Then I rush toward the entrance to the kitchen. I hear some footsteps running. And not just one set, but multiple. I catch a glance of the ones running away and see that they’re the chefs.</p><p>“I knew it.”</p><p>So Cent referred to me as “Lady Two” since he knew everyone was peeking.</p><p>“Oooh! I told you I’d be fine by myself! Why can’t you trust me?”</p><p>A large hand gently touches my cheek as I pout. Then I notice Cent’s gorgeous face in front of mine.</p><p>“You can’t blame them, now can you? After all, you are a precious Intoner to everyone in this land.”</p><p>Ah! My cheeks light on fire at the touch of his hand. What should I do? I can’t stop blushing. And he’s not giving me time to think.</p><p>“But obviously, no one in this world cares for you as deeply as I.”</p><p>I can’t take it! Mv heart’s about to burst!</p><p><i>What should I do? What should I do? </i>What should I do!?<i/></p><p>"Two?"</p><p>How can Cent be so handsome? He’s not only handsome, but he’s kind, too. And he tells us all these funny stories. But when we’re alone... Yeee!</p><p>“Two? Are you feeling all right, my dear? It might be best to lie down in the bedroom.”</p><p>The bedroom? D-Don’t say another word! Yeee! Yeee! Yeee!</p><p>“Why dont we take a break from cooking for the moment...”</p><p>That reminds me of something important.</p><p>“No! I have to cook today!”</p><p>Calm down, calm down! I have to cook for Cent today! It’ll be a dinner for us the two of us! I’ve been preparing for this for two whole weeks! Breathe, breathe...</p><p>“Then, may I lend a hand?”</p><p>“Absolutely not! I won’t allow it! You can’t look, either! Where’s the fun if you know what I’m making?”</p><p>Oooh, but...</p><p><br/>“...But it’d be nice if you could stick around, just to keep me company."</p><p>"As you wish, my lady.”</p><p>Ack! He’s giving me that cute smile of his! That’s so unfair! How am I supposed to concentrate!? ...Breathe. I need to breathe... Calm down. Okay, I’m okay. I take a couple more breaths and then tap my cheeks.</p><p>“All right! I’m in the groove! Cent, take a seat over there."</p><p>I point to the chair in the corner, trying not to look at Cent’s face as much as possible. Can you blame me? My heart would start pounding again if I looked at his face! All right, then. Back to cooking.</p><p>“Rrragh!”</p><p>I place the water-filled pot on the counter. Then I cast my spell.</p><p>The magical glyph glows and ignites a fire that engulfs the pot. I don’t know how, but this counter seems to have been used for some sort of ceremony. I suppose that shouldn’t be a surprise. This room wasn’t a kitchen when we first got here; this whole place was actually a shrine—not the most accommodating of places.</p><p>But my sister One gave me orders to “rule over the Land of Sands and protect the shrine," so I decided to live in it! Living in the shrine was the most convenient option, after all. I mean, I didn’t have to worry about building a new house! Though I did have to redecorate the place a bit. To spruce it up, you know?</p><p>For instance, there was this room with lots of old books and scrolls, so I had the books taken out and made it into a bedroom. There was tons of dust, but I cleaned the place thoroughly and scrubbed the floor spotless, so it’s really nice now.</p><p>I put up some wallpaper with small flowers on it. There was a kilt with a similar pattern, so I turned that into the bedcover. Then I placed a table with carved legs next to the bed for a nightstand and placed a vase with flowers on it. I always wanted a cute room, you know.</p><p>The only thing missing are some adorable curtains, but this shrine’s underground, so there aren’t any windows... Still, it’s a comfortable place to live in. It’s cool inside when it’s hot outside, and when it’s cold outside, it’s nice and warm here. I bet whoever built this shrine had the extreme weather in mind when designing the place. Although it is annoying to need candles on all the time to get any light down here, even during the day.</p><p>Another perk of living underground is that food doesn’t spoil easily. I made this ceremony room into a kitchen and I didn’t even have to make a storage area for food! But I still need to make sure that our supplies are kept away from heat.</p><p>Oh, and I wanted to eat with all the soldiers and neighbors, so I made the really laaarge area in the middle into a dining hall by placing a bunch of chairs and tables there. Food always tastes better when you’re eating with a large group. right?</p><p>But I thought it’d be nice to have dinner alone with Cent, even if it was just once in a while. So, that’s why I decided to cook today. I gave all the chef and servants the day off. Everyone needs some time off to relax.</p><p>“Here we go. The veggies have all been prepped. so I need to get the meat ready."</p><p>“Two, is that tro—”</p><p>"Yes, it’s troll. I skinned it and cut it up into chunks, I’m going to stew it with some herbs. Oh, I made sure to drain the blood so there’s nothing to worry about. Rrraght!”</p><p>I use a sword to cleave the joint. Troll bones are super tough, so normal knives won’t do. They chip too easily. Luckily, only the bones are hard. The meat is actually nice and soft. That’s why you can use troll meat for various dishes and not just stews. You can fry it, or you can cut it into thin slices and broil it, or even batter and deep fry it. Pickling the meat and then storing it in a barrel will let it hold for six months, too! It’s such a great way to preserve food!</p><p>The only problem is that trolls are pretty heavy, so it’s difficult to work with the meat unless you’re strong. I think that’s why more people don’t know that troll meat is so useful. Of course, I’m sure we’d see more of it if troll pelts had any kind of value...but they smell so awful that no one wants them.</p><p>“A whole troll might be too much for the two of us... Grrragh!”</p><p>I rub some salt and wine into the meat once I cut it into chunks. Removing the tendons is quite a chore, but it’s also a lot of fun. I love cooking.</p><p>“It’s wonderful to have a place to cook whenever I feel like it.”</p><p>We hardly stopped anywhere with a proper kitchen when we were traveling. It was mostly cooking meat or fish over an open fire, and that’s it.</p><p>We’d occasionally come across an empty house with a kitchen. And by occasionally, I mean rarely. But it always brought a smile to my face when we did and I always insisted that the cook take the day off so that I could prepare a meal for everyone.</p><p>“By the way, who’s the best cook amongst the Intoners?”</p><p>“That would definitely be One.”</p><p>“And not you?”</p><p>I think about Cent’s question for a second. I definitely enjoy cooking the most, but One’s the best cook. There’s no doubt about it. That being said...</p><p>“No, One’s the best. But if you asked her, I’m sure she’d tell you that anyone could do what she does."</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Well, she thinks that the basics of cooking are so easy that even a child could do it. She just can’t understand how someone could mess up such a simple task.”</p><p>“I see. So Lady One believes that cooking comes naturally. However, cooking is not comprised of just the basics.”</p><p>“She said you can apply the basics to anything if you give it a little thought.”</p><p>The problem is that “just a little thought” for One is thinking up a storm for most other people.</p><p>“What about Lady Three? She’s skilled in handling blades, isn't she?”</p><p>“I guess you could call them blades, but Three’s specialty is scissors.”</p><p>There are scissors specifically for cooking, but Three’s scissors aren't really for for that. I think there was a time where she used them to cut open a fish, and the fish ended up all mangled. But then One used a rock to grind the fish. She then rolled out the fish meat and broiled it. It was so delicious! She then reminded us that it’s simply <i>impossible</i> to  mess up cooking.</p><p>“On top of that, Three doesn't seem to like tampering with things much. She’s the type that likes to enjoy the natural flavor of a dish. Like enjoying fresh ingredients the way they are.</p><p>"...It sounds like she’s just lazy."</p><p>“Hmmm... I guess you could say that."</p><p>We were always given vegetables whole if Three was in charge of cooking. I think Three just never was interested in cooking.</p><p>“Oh, but Four did say that you shouldn't overcook vegetables. If you do, then you’d lose a lot of nutrients.”</p><p>I think she said that veggies found above ground should be left uncooked, while veggies taken from the ground <i>should</i> be. That’s why it’s better to ear fruits and leafy greens raw while it’s better to boil or cook onions and potatoes. At least, according to Four.</p><p>“She also said that it’s best to have a meat-to-vegetable ratio of one-to-two. And that it’s better to eat fruits in the mornings and to eat fish at least twice a week.”</p><p>I think she also said that using sugar and salt too much isn’t good, either. The food was always bland whenever Four was in charge of cooking. I guess it can’t be helped. I mean, when Four cooked, Five would pour salt on without even tasting the food, saying, “This is just the right amount for your dishes, my dear sister.”</p><p>“But you know, it’s because of her understanding of food that Four’s cooking makes you feel really healthy It’s almost medicinal.”</p><p>“It sounds like her food is just overly bland.”</p><p>"Uhhh... I guess you could say that.”</p><p>But her cooking is perfect if you’re sick. You could eat whatever she made even if you had an upset stomach. I remember a time when we stayed with a farmer and Four cooked dinner to show our thanks. The grandma was so happy. She said that there were so many things she couldn’t eat because of her old age. But she ate everything that Four made that night.</p><p>"How is Lady Five's cooking?" </p><p>Five’s cooking is the complete opposite of Four’s. Whereas Four’s cooking is perfect for sick people, only the fittest can handle Five’s cooking. It’s like you need courage to eat it!”</p><p>Five loves really spicy meat and oily foods. She’d use a ton of sugar or salt while cooking, too. Four would always complain that there weren’t enough greens in Five’s cooking or that it was too rich. Five also loves exotic foods. She’d toss in plenty of herbs or mushrooms that she found into her dishes. Even grotesque-looking ingredients were fair game. I’m more open to various foods now because of Five... Who would have thought insects could be so tasty if they’re prepared right?</p><p>The thing is, Five doesn’t care at all if something’s unhealthy or dangerous. I remember a time when she made a stew with fish and mushrooms. We all got horribly sick after eating that stew. According to One, Five used a poisonous fish whole. One also said that colorful mushrooms shouldn’t be eaten. Considering Five put both of those into her stew, it’s no wonder we all got sick.</p><p>But that kind of incident never deterred Five. The next time she was in charge of dinner, she tried to use some red mushrooms with white spots in a salad and Four gave her a thorough scolding. I’m not sure if Five has thick skin, but she sure is consistent. She'll bring some exotic ingredients whenever she visits and always asks, “Is this edible, Two?” And every time, I try to come up with creative recipes to utilize them fully. It’s more fun than you might think! It’s almost like trying to figure out how to make tough meat tender, or how to get rid of the foul odors meat can give off. I’ll try anything—hitting the food, drying it out in the sun, or brining it in wine or oil. Oh, the feeling I get when I can make something I thought was completely inedible into something delicious! Nothing beats that!</p><p>Five seems to understand how I feel. She started off bringing me unusual fish and nuts, but then she started bringing extremely difficult ingredients to use, like carnivorous plants and fish with poisonous spines. I guess the greater the challenge, the greater the reward, right? Just the other day, she went out and caught a sandworm in the desert, and it wasn’t a tiny one either. She really surprised me with that one. It was gargantuan! I mean, how can you not give it your all after seeing something like that and the effort she put into catching it? I did my best, and a couple of days later, I made a wonderful sandworm soup! I was so happy when the soup was done. It feels wonderful when your efforts are rewarded, doesn’t it?</p><p>“Five’s the type that constantly aims high. You could say she’s adventurous—courageous even—when it comes to food. No, that’s not right. Maybe an evangelist? A guru? Uh...what’s the word?”</p><p>“I believe you mean her tastes are <i>bizarre.</i>"</p><p>“Ummm... Well, I guess you could say that.”</p><p>But when living in the land of Sands, having a bizarre taste is a vital survival skill. It’s not unusual to go days without a drop of rain here. This country is more Likely to see a year of famine than one with plenty of rain. If you can catch a monster and use it for food, then you won’t die of starvation, right? We can all dine together no matter what happens, and it’s all thanks to Five.</p><p>“Anyway, the troll’s ready. I just need to simmer it for a while. And now...”</p><p>I open the barrel I had sitting in the corner of the kitchen after I toss the troll meat chunks into the stew. The smell of liquor stings my nose. I’ve been preparing this for two whole weeks.</p><p>“Okay, it’s looking good.”</p><p>Now to put it onto the counter.</p><p>"Rragh! Ha! Ha!"</p><p>Smack! Smack! I strike the meat repeatedly with a club.</p><p>“Two...’what is that?"</p><p>“Oh, this? It’s minotaur thigh. I think it’s called tendon or something. It’s from the minotaurs we slew a while ago. I pickled the remaining meat since we didn’t finish it all, remember?”</p><p>I washed the meat thoroughly, soused it. and then let it sit in wine two weeks ago. Minotaur meat is delicious, but it’s so tough that it needs a good tenderizing first.</p><p>“I’m pounding the meat to tenderize it so that it’s nice and soft. Then I’m going to cut it up and stir-fry it with some veggies. Huh? Wait a minute... I’ve been telling you what I’m making haven’t I? I guess asking you not to look was kind of pointless...”</p><p>“No, my lady. It is not pointless. It’s obvious that such explanations are beyond the comprehension of disciple of my caliber.”</p><p>“Wow! That’s incredible! You’re so amazing Cent!”</p><p>What should I do? My heart won’t stop racing! Why is Cent so handsome and charming? I love him so much that I could die! Wait, no... I can’t be with him if I die. But I don’t know what to do! My heart can’t take this anymore! It’s beating so fast!</p><p>“Dab, what am I thinking about? Be still, my beating heart! I need to calm down! Focus...focus! Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!”</p><p>I smack the minotaur tendon over and over.</p><p>“Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!”</p><p>Phew, this is hard work... And all this smacking has actually calmed me down. I am kind of out of breath, though... And... Oh dear. The tendon looks like minced meat. And there’s a crack in the counter...</p><p>“Oops...I guess I overdid it. Oh well. Hehehe.” </p><p>I collect myself and attempt to start cutting up the veggies when I hear some voices from the door. </p><p>"Two!"</p><p>"Let's play!"</p><p>"Play with us, please!"</p><p>"Huh? What's the matter?"</p><p>I see their cute little faces all lined up by the door. Oh, these precious little children.</p><p>They’re orphans. The Land of Sands is impoverished and the old ruler was a really lousy guy, so a lot of people, adults and children, died under his rule. These kids survived, but they were left all alone. That's why I decided to take them in an live together. Even if their moms and dads aren't here, they won't be lonely if we're all together.</p><p>I was never lonely growing up because I had One, Three, Four, and Five by my side. There were times when I'd remember Mom and Dad and want tocry, but I never did. And that's because I had my sisters.</p><p>But why are the children even here? "I thought you were all leaving for a slumber party."</p><p>I had everyone at the shrine take the day off, so I asked them to take care of the kids for the day.</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>"We came back."</p><p>"We wanna be with you!"</p><p>"Come on, let's play!"</p><p>Oh, these adorable kids are holding hands lined up by the entry way. They're my...family. Then I feel a hand gently touch my shoulder.</p><p>"Don't worry about me, Two."</p><p>I turn around to see Cent's smiling face. Ah, Cent completely understands. My feelings, my desires, what's important to me. Everything. It's not because I'm an Intoner and he's my disciple, right? I'm sure that I'd have fallen in love with Cent and he'd have fallen in love with me no matter what our roles were... Right?</p><p>"Let's have a dinner for two some other time."</p><p>"Yeah. Thank you, Cent."</p><p>I love you, Cent. I love you more than anyone in this whole world. I'm so glad we met.</p><p>"All right, wait a sec, okay? I'm making a yummy meal and we can all eat together when I'm done!"</p>The children squeal in joy. I go back to cooking for my beloved Cent and my precious family.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

Although I copied someone else’s way of making it, it’s my very own doll that I made. It turned out much better than I thought, so I was very pleased.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>The Mr. Soldier doll I copied, is actually from a game called “chess”. The Mr. Soldier I took from the lord’s castle was the first doll I’ve ever owned. I’ve always liked dolls since I was little, but I’ve never had one of my own. After I got caught taking it outside the castle, One scolded me, but I couldn’t let go of the doll. Because, it was my first. Even if I get scolded, I like dolls.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I made my eighth doll. I am now done with the black Mr. Soldier dolls. I think I’ll start making white Mr. Soldier dolls tomorrow.</p><p><br/>Month X / Day X</p><p>I finished making the white Mr. Soldier dolls. Now, I’m finished with all the Mr. Soldiers, so I’ll be making other dolls tomorrow. On the “Chess board” I saw, there were dolls on horses, but I don’t think I’ll make horses. It’s because I like dolls that are in the shape of humans, rather than animals. There were also dolls of houses, but that’s boring so I won’t make those either. Besides, dolls made into houses aren’t human-shaped, right? Houses can’t move or talk. So, instead of horses and houses, I wonder what kind of dolls I should make? There are kings and queens. Maybe I should make a doll with strange clothes, such as the “bishop”. But, what is a bishop? I think I’ll look into it next time.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I looked up “bishop” and found out what it is. They are important people called “priests”. They wear strange clothes and hats. In the book, it was written that “bishops” shave the top of their heads, and don’t have any hair. I didn’t know that, so I initially made the “bishop” doll have a normal head under its hat. I immediately trimmed the doll’s hair to make it shorter. It was difficult making it into a nice round shape, as shown in the book; however, it is now a proper “bishop” doll.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I was reading about a living being that has an upper-half of a human’s body, and the lower-half of a horse. I’d been wondering what I should do instead of a horse doll, so this is perfect, and I’ve decided to make it. I kept reading the book, hoping there might be something to replace the house doll, too.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>In chess, the horse doll is known as the “knight”. So that’s it. I could’ve just made a human doll riding on a horse from the start. I recall seeing a chess doll riding on a horse at the lord’s castle. Since there were more that weren’t riding a horse, I thought that would be normal. Either way, since I already made it, it’s fine. I also checked to see if the “house” doll could be something else, and it wasn’t a house, but a castle (rook). Since it’s not a human or a living thing, I was disappointed. After giving it some thought, I decided to make the castle doll into a monster I saw in a book. It was a giant monster. If I tie both arms behind, and twist the legs, it looks like a building, right? Just to make it look more like a building, I’ll add stairs and ladders to it.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I finished making all 64 pieces of the chess dolls. After lining them up, I can see that I’ve gotten better. I’m happy. I wonder what kind of dolls I should make next.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I made a doll from my own ideas, instead of copying one. Up until now, it was always troublesome gathering the material, but making it like this won’t involve such troubles. Besides, it’s much more wonderful and prettier than a chess doll. This time, it really is my very own doll. My cute, cute doll.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I played with all the dolls I’ve made. In the picture book, there was a girl who played with dolls, so I decided to play with them too. The girl in the book played with her father doll, mother doll, grandmother doll, grandfather doll, and children dolls. But I don’t really like my father and mother, so playing that way wasn’t very fun. Besides, I don’t have a grandfather or grandmother. Octa is a grandfather, but not mine. I’ll think of a different way to play.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I played “bad-guy hunting” with my dolls. I prepared a One doll, Two doll, Four doll and Five doll, and beat up the bad lord. They’re dolls and don’t have the power of songs, so I believe I was able to well replicate the part they all united their powers to fight. It was very fun, but the bad lord’s doll broke. I must now make a new doll. It’s fun to play, but I think I prefer making instead.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I played “teatime” with my dolls. Playing “bad-guy hunting” broke my dolls, but drinking tea and speaking shouldn’t break them. Having conversations with the dolls is very fun. The dolls pay close attention to my stories. The dolls never complain. They don’t say things like, “What does that mean?” or “I don’t know what you’re saying”. For being so well-behaved, I made them sweets. I also made tea. It’s a very pretty purple-tea that looks like a jewel. I wanted to match the sweets, but I couldn’t get them to be the same color, so they were green sweets. After feeding the dolls sweets and giving them tea to drink, their faces turned to a dirty color. I washed them but they would not return to their normal colors. To top it off, they got a strange smell, so I decided to throw them away. I must now make new dolls. I won’t be playing “teatime” anymore.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I like dolls, but I also like scissors. From the cutting-sound it makes, to the feeling I get in my hands, I love everything about it. When I cut my hair, I have so much fun, I even forget to eat at times. When I tried cutting Octa’s hair, it wasn’t like mine, and it was very hard and rough. I tried cutting his moustache, but he ran away. Actually, I wanted to make him look like a “bishop”. While I like scissors, I don’t think Octa does. And they’re so fun, too. Also, it doesn’t seem as though Octa likes dolls that much, either.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Octa wears strange shoes. They have a funny shape. I wanted to make my dolls wear them, but Octa wouldn’t let me borrow them. Even though he wears such shoes, he’s actually very fast when he runs away. The time I tried to cut his moustache, he ran away with surprisingly fast speed. When I tried cutting other parts, he was even faster. Weirdo. I wonder why he doesn’t want it? It’s fun. I really don’t know. Now that I mention it, lately, Octa doesn’t play with me much. That’s because Octa doesn’t like dolls. I want to play with dolls. I think Octa, who doesn’t like dolls, should go play by himself.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I spent a lot of time thinking about the meaning of “cuter”. Personally, I think all the dolls are cute. They’re all cute in their own ways. Maybe because of that, I didn’t know the meaning of “cute” versus “cuter”. Then, I decided I’d to put them in order, from simply “cute” to “cuter” and maybe I’d understand the difference.I gathered all the dolls I’ve made up until now, and arranged them in order of “cuteness”. I was then able to note the difference. Firstly, ones with wider foreheads are cuter than the ones with narrow foreheads. Then, the ones with bigger heads are cuter than smaller heads. Instead of small and thin eyes, the ones with large and wide eyes are cuter. Smaller mouths and noses are also cuter. The ones with plump cheeks are cuter. The dolls with fat and short arms and legs are cuter, too. The ones with their stomachs sticking out are cuter than ones with flat stomachs. So that means, I’ll make them with bigger heads, wider foreheads, big eyes, smaller mouths and noses, and plump cheeks.Yes, I have it! The way to make dolls cuter. I think I’ll try it out first thing tomorrow.</p><p><br/>Month X / Day X</p><p>Today, I worked on making the dolls “cuter”. After trying, though, it was much more difficult than I had expected. First of all, it was difficult to make their heads larger. This is because the dolls’ heads are hard. It’s not like I can inflate them like a balloon. Making foreheads wider, and noses smaller, didn’t go too well, either. This is because I can’t carve them like wood, or mold and make them rounder like clay.After trying this and that, things didn’t go too well, and I ruined one doll; however, I did finally stumble upon a good idea. Since it’s hard to change the size of their heads, what if I were to change the size of their bodies instead? I thought I could change the length of their arms and legs. After trying it, I was able to do it. I thought it might be difficult to make their bellies poke out, but after looking at the pillow on my bed, I was strucky by another good idea. The more the insides of pillows and cushions are filled, the fluffier they become. All I have to do is fill the dolls’ stomachs with more “fluff”. Sure enough, after filling then with plenty of “fluff,” they developed nice round stomachs. It was a great success.</p><p>Since I was able to make their stomachs nice and plump, I did the same to their arms and legs, too. They became cute and plump arms and legs. Their fingers would also look cuter if they were more plump, so filled them up with “fluff” as well, one by one, even though it was a little difficult. I even filled their palms. Then when I put on their previous heads, I was able to make them into dolls with large heads, with plump arms and legs. However, I’m still not very good at it, so their width and length didn’t match, and they looked a awkward. If I make many like I did with the chess dolls, I think I’ll become better. I thought I’d do my best tomorrow.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I became better at making plump dolls with big heads today. They no longer look awkward. While making them, I noticed that the “cuter dolls” have limbs and bellies that resemble those of a baby. Babies also have large heads. They also have wide foreheads, and wide eyes, with small mouths and noses. That’s it… making them “cuter” means making them look like babies. Yes, I understand now.</p><p>I’ll try making their cheeks a little more squishy. That’s how baby cheeks are, aren’t they? Perhaps I’ll fill them with something softer than “fluff,” too. What should it be? I think I’ll give it some more thought.</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I spent the entire day looking for “cheek filling”. Something very soft with a nice feel to it. The insides of a featherbed? How about the insides of a cushion? what about a plush? Or sweets? I tried cutting many things that are plump or fluffy, to check their insides.</p><p>When I cut the featherbed, many tiny feathers scattered across the room. I accidentally inhaled some, and couldn’t stop sneezing. After cutting sweet and fluffy snacks, my scissors got sticky from the cream. After seeing me sneezing while licking off the sticky cream, Octa began to look, looking disturbed at the same time. After that, Octa washed my hair and changed my clothes that were covered in feathers, and I finally stopped sneezing. But I couldn’t find something that could be used as a filling for cheeks. What are baby cheeks made of…?</p><p>Month X / Day X</p><p>I tried many different ways, but in the end, I decided to loosen the strings inside the cheeks of the dolls. This seemed like the best way to do it. I carefully loosened the white, red, and pink strings, and made them into soft, fine threads that filled the insides of their cheeks. I had to make them fluffy, and not jam-packed. They also couldn’t be shriveled up, so I kept on feeling them with my fingers to test their softness.</p><p><br/>Month X / Day X</p><p>It took days and days, but I was finally able to make a “cuter doll” with baby-like cheeks. It has a plump stomach, with plump arms and legs. My cute, cute doll.</p><p>However, I want to make even cuter dolls. What kind of dolls are even cuter? What could their insides consist of? What kind of material should I use? What would make it even cuter? I think I’ll give it some more thought.</p>I think Octa wants to play, but I’m too busy. After making a cuter doll, I think I’ll just want to make an even cuter doll after that. I wonder what kind of doll I should make next. I want something that is much cuter, so I can have many more dolls to play with. Tee hee hee… hehehe.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

I know it was you. Don't just leave your clothes lying on the floor!"</p><p>I've already yelled at her to clean it up. So what if the house is abandoned and no one lives here? It isn't ours to do with as we please. We're here to rest from our travels and take shelter—that's <i>it</i>. And when we leave, we need to put things back the way we found them. We're not slobs.</p><p>But Five has been shedding her clothes and spilling her food like she owns the place. She ought to try cleaning up after herself. Well, I suppose it's to be expected from the youngest in any family.</p><p>I start to fold her dress and catch myself grimacing. There's a big tear in the seam under the sleeve. Oh, of course. She probably forgot all about this dress the second she found something else to change into. "What am I going to do with her?"</p><p>I let out a big sigh. Not only do I clean up after Five, I wind up mending her clothes, too. But she's all thumbs, anyway; if I made her do the needlework, we'd just wind up with more rags. Either that, or she'd prick her finger or something and make a big scene. Best to avoid the trouble and handle this myself. One open seam won't take more than a few minutes.</p><p>I spread out the dress to check it for other tears, and now I've noticed there's hair all over the floor. "Three," I groan. "Not you, too."</p><p>Three has made a bad habit of this: sitting down any old place and then getting her hair all over everything when she cuts it. It's not my older sister's fault her hair grows faster than other people's, but honestly, I swear she does this for kicks. I mean, if it's that much of a hassle, she could just chop it off at shoulder length. But Three cuts the ends; she'll just grab a clump of hair and <i>snick, snick</i> away at it with her scissors. I think she enjoys it. You could almost call it a hobby—a really weird one, in my opinion.</p><p>In fact, she's a little weird in general. All right, a lot weird. Exceedingly weird. Actually, I'm still mincing words. She's a certifiable loon.</p><p>As I think this, I hear the <i>snick, snick</i> getting closer. Here she comes. "Three, would you stop getting your hair all—" But <i>over the place</i> is dead on arrival. Three has been cutting her hair as she walks. With each <i>snick,</i> more of her silky hair flutters toward the floor.</p><p>"Need something?" she says. The fallen hair is getting on everything. Her brazenesss has knocked the words right out of me. If it were Five, I would already be yelling, "Stop making a mess!"</p><p>"Three, maybe you shouldn't cut your hair while you walk."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Why not? Because... Because scissors are sharp, right? If your hand slips, you could hurt yourself."</p><p>"I'll be fine." Three cuts off another lock of hair as if to say: <i>See? Not dangerous.</i> I feel my shoulders slump. What a waste of time. I should have known who I was dealing with right from the start.</p><p>"All right, you'll be fine. But could you please pick up the hair you've gotten all over everything? This isn't our house." I shudder to think what the next people to come in will think if they find mounds of hair all over the floor. I know I'd be creeped out. "Here you go." I hold out a broom realizing as I do that it's another waste of time.</p><p>"I'm tired," says Three. Sure enough, she flops down on her butt, keels over, and is asleep before I can blink. She's not <i>pretending</i> to be asleep; she's actually doing it. It's incredible, in a way.</p><p>I can't sleep if you so much as switch out my pillow, but Three—she can deal with a different mattress, or no mattress at all, or even just a patch of dirt. If she can get horizontal, she can sleep. You could raise the roof right next to her and she wouldn't care. No matter how dirty her clothes get, she doesn't mind. As delicate as she looks, Three is a tough one to faze.</p><p>It's a shame. Three has the prettiest face of all of us. But despite being a beautiful young woman, she's impudent and slovenly and just plain odd. I doubt anyone would believe it if you told them.</p><p>What a shame about her hair too. It's straight and lustrous and feels just like silk, and here she is clumsily hacking it to pieces. If I had hair like that, I'd cut it nice and even, or at least do it up properly. And if I had Three's face, wouldn't catch me rolling around on the floor. I would want to be <i>presentable</i>. I can't fathom how someone could be born this pretty and wreck it all with bad hair and worse behavior. Three is frittering away nature's gifts. She doesn't even seem the slightest bit interested in using her head, as smart as she is.</p><p>Maybe that's what separates the loons from the non-loons. I bet loons never give any thought to falling in love or leading ordinary, happy lives.</p><p>Once I've put a coat on Three so she doesn't catch a cold, I clean up the hair on the floor and stitch up Five's dress. I've really gotten the short end of the stick, haven't I?</p><p>Three may be strange beyond reproach, but I've got to do something about Five. We're hurting her in the long run by letting her act spoiled and take people for granted all the time just because she's the youngest. Today, I need to finally give her a good talking-to.</p><p>And how unfair is that? I'm sure I must have been the youngest child up until Five was born, but I have no memory of it. As far back as I can remember, Five has been there and I've been on big sister duty as second youngest. Grown-ups tell me I need to "tough it out" because I'm older, as if <i>that</i> makes any sense. When have I ever begged to have my way or burdened people the way Five does?</p><p>You know, I'm probably not cut out to be a youngest child anyway. My conscience and common sense would get in the way if I tried to pull one of Five's selfish tricks. The first thing to jump to mind would be how much I'm putting other people out. And more than anything—</p><p>"Four? Did you want to see me?"</p><p><i>This.</i> I can't be this smooth a customer. Never in a million years will I have the brass to wait until right <i>after</i> someone finishes mending my clothes to come crawling in.</p><p>"You know you're not supposed to leave your clothes lying around. How many times do I have to tell you? And look what you did to the seam!"</p><p>"Oh, that's not me."</p><p>"I don't want to hear it. I stitched it up for you this time, but next time you're on your own."</p><p>"It really wasn't me! Honest." The nerve of her. Who but Five could ever be a big enough slouch to try and pin the blame on someone else?</p><p>"Oh, Four. Sorry!" says a tomboyish voice. "That one's my fault." My older sister Two is scratching herself when she turns up. She can get a little rough around the edges, but what baffles me is that it comes across as lovable. If I acted like that, people would probably mistake me for an actual boy, not some lovable tomboy. And if Five tried it, they'd think she popped a screw. Why is Two the only one who gets to be able to pull it off?</p><p>Well, anyway.</p><p>"But, Two, this is Five's dress." It doesn't have her name written on it, but I'm pretty good at remembering whose clothes are whose. When you have to pick up after everyone and mend their clothes, you get pretty good at telling people's belongings apart. So the dress is clearly Five's. The thing is, Two would never lie to me...</p><p>"Yeah. It <i>was</i> Five's dress." Aha. Mystery solved. So that's what happened. I knew Two wouldn't lie to me. "Was" means she got the dress as a hand-me-down. It makes sense. Total sense. No further explanation needed. I get it. Please don't go there, Five!</p><p>But she does.</p><p>"The dress was squeezing me so hard I just couldn't wear it anymore." Five sticks out her chest as she explains, and I feel a tinge of anger. A girl her age shouldn't be this developed, let alone flaunt it. It's sick. She ought to be ashamed of herself. I mean, what is it they say? You're born with either tits or wits?</p><p>"Five said she was done with it, so I took it off her hands." Two explains with a big smile, completely unfazed by our little sister's pig show. Would it hurt Two to reprimand Five just once? It's a big sister's duty, if you ask me. "But when I tried it on, I flexed a little too hard and...<i>rrrip.</i>"</p><p>"The seam burst."</p><p>"Bingo! That's right, Four." Two's muscles are overpowered, so she's always breaking things or punching holes in the wall. But then she says, "Oh no!" and turns white as a sheet. It's kind of ironic that one of us with the best intentions does the most damage. She'd be a real catch otherwise.</p><p>"Can you <i>believe</i> I ruined a dress someone just gave me? I went to find a needle and thread to see if I could fix it up."</p><p>"Here you are, Two." I hold out the dress, which is all stitched up now. Unlike Five, Two can take care of herself, but she's a little clumsy. She's decent enough with her fingers, but a little disorganized, you might say. So I tend to get thinks taken care of first. It doesn't upset me though, since Two isn't trying to unload her chores on people.</p><p>"Whoa! Hang on. You're kidding. You did this for me? This is amazing! How'd you do it so fast? It's perfect!" Two will never flatter you or dole out empty compliments. Her praise comes from the heart. Everything about her does; she's cheerful, eager, kind, compassionate.</p><p>But my sister is so honest sometimes that I worry about her. Those same qualities can be flipped around and used against you. People like that are easy to trick and to take advantage of, right?</p><p>Which is bad enough in itself, but Two is likeable and attractive. It wouldn't surprise if unsavory sorts came up to her with less than good intentions. She projects a sort of helplessness and flightiness which makes her look like an easy mark. And, in fact, she probably <i>is</i> an easy mark.</p><p>But knowing her, even if she did get burned, she'd probably bounce right back and convince herself it was a one-time mistake. I'm sure she'd say "This time I'll meet Mr. Right," and keep letting men use her and then toss her aside. Another troubling thought.</p><p>I mean, someone as attractive as her shouldn't be throwing away her life to chase after a bunch of worthless jerks, right? With her good looks? Talk about going downhill. What a tragedy. It worries me sick just imagining. That's right. I'm only thinking of her!</p><p>"Four, you're the <i>best!</i> Let me go try it on." I hear Two squealing in delight as she does, and next she's saying, "Yay! It's a perfect fit!" as she turns in circles. It almost feels like <i>I'm</i> the big sister.</p><p>"Well? What do you think? Huh?" Once Five and I manage a nod, Two's face lights up in a big grin and she wheels around. "I've got to show this to One!" she gasps, and flies out of the room without even shutting the door. She can be such a child. Well, she <i>is</i> a child. This whole journey, we've been going around trouncing villains and monsters that have been tormenting innocent people. It's been easy to forget that we're all still kids. And Five doesn't help with all that flaunting and the filth she spouts.</p><p>"Oh, Four." The indecent creature is slinking up behind me right now. I've got a bad feeling about this. "Now did I lie to you or not?"</p><p>"No. I misjudged you."</p><p>"Why do you always have to treat me like the villain? You hurt my feelings," she says with absolutely no hurt in her voice. I can feel her pressing right up against my back.</p><p>"I was wrong," I manage.</p><p>"Is that it? Aren't you going to say you're sorry?"</p><p>"I'm sorry," I manage again.</p><p>"I can't <i>hear</i> you."</p><p>"I said, I'm <i>SORRY!</i>" Ugh. I'm not usually this easy to get to. She thinks she's so smart. Jerk. "could you get away from me now? You're crushing me."</p><p>Her and her oversized bazoom! It ticks me off!</p><p>"Mmm," she moans. "You don't like being crushed? Why? Because you can't do it with those pancakes?"</p><p>"WELL, EXCUSE ME AND MY PANCAKES! LIKE I'D EVER WANT TO BE LIKE YOU! GET AWAY FROM ME, IT'S HOT ENOUGH IN HERE! AND DON'T 'MMM' ME! YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE ACTING LIKE SOME FILTHY WHORE. I BET THE FOOD YOU EAT GOES RIGHT TO YOUR TITS AND YOU'VE GOT THE BRAINS OF A STUPID COW. YOU STUPID DUMBSHIT! DUMBSHIT, DUMBSHIT, DUMBSHIT!"</p><p>"Oh, Four! Stop! You're so scary."</p><p>"SHUT UP! BITCHCOW! GO EAT SOME BITCHGRASS!" Soon, I'm grabbing everything within reach and throwing it at her. But she writhes and moans and dodges it all, which only manages to piss me off even more.</p><p><i>I hate you so much! All of you! I despise you! I know I'll never be lovable like Two or beautiful like Three. I know that compared to Five I'm a pancake! I hate myself! I hate my face! My body! I'm not pretty or lovable and I have the most average face you can imagine. My arms and legs are gangly and I look like a twig that can never get my stupid hair to straighten out!</i></p><p><i>And these horrid nails! I hate them so much I just want to die. They keep growing and growing and get all curly and weird if I don't clip them, or else they crack or they get caught on everything. They're useless and I wish I could just rip them straight off. My arms are useless, my legs are useless, my face is useless—all of me is useless!</i></p><p><i>Maybe...I'm useless.</i></p><p><i>Me? Useless? No! I'm not the one who's useless!</i></p><p><i>YOU ARE, YOU WORTHLESS FOUL-MOUTHED SLUT! IF YOU THINK YOU AND THOSE FLOPPY SACKS OF MEAT ARE SPECIAL, THEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER GODDAMN THING COMING! A SHIT WOULD TURN ITS NOSE UP AT YOU, YOU'RE NOTHING, SO FUCK OFF!</i></p><p><i>YOU TOO! YOU MUSCLE-BOUND LOVEY-DOVEY FREAK! AND YOU, YOU FUCKED-UP-WACK-JOB SCISSOR FIEND! YOUR BIG FAT BRAIN DOESN'T MEAN JACK SHIT! YOU AND YOUR STUPID PRETTY SKIN. IF IT'S SO PRETTY, WHY DON'T I RIP IT RIGHT OFF SO YOU CAN STARE AT IT? I'LL YANK IT RIGHT OVER YOUR BITCH SHOULDERS AND TEAR IT INTO TINY FUCKING PIECES SO YOU CAN WATCH ME <b>GRIND</b> IT INTO THE FLOOR!</i></p><p>I'm laughing maniacally now. <i>I FEEL BETTER! I FEEL <b>MUCH</b> BETTER!</i></p><p>When I come around, the room is in shambles. And yet there's Three, still sound asleep. The fact that she managed to stay dead to the world through that much commotion has to make her some kind of prodigy. A loon prodigy.</p><p>Five must have fled the scene a while ago. She's not very smart, but she is smooth.</p><p>"I am such an idiot." I know I have to get this cleaned up fast. Whoever makes the mess has to clean it up. Everyone knows that. But when I see my sisters not doing it, I start to feel pretty stupid being the only one playing by the rules.</p><p>I put back the chairs and table I had upended, pick up the decanter, and wipe the floor. Oh no, I can't believe it. Was I throwing dishes? Five hadn't bothered to clear her place, and even now there are bits of food stuck to the pieces.</p><p>I sigh. "Why me?" But while Five may not have cleaned the dishes up, I'm the one who threw them and broke them. This is on me. From now on, I'll have to keep my temper tantrums to a minimum. Even if I get mad, I need to hold it in. Because no matter what I say or do, I'm only hurting myself in the end.</p><p>When at last the cleaning is done, I take a seat in a chair. I sure am tired. Maybe not on Three's level—but really tired.</p><p>"Is anyone here?"</p><p>My head has been face down on the table, but I look up. My eldest sister has just come in. "One, what's wrong?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm glad you're here, Four. Can you help me?"</p><p>"Should I wake Three up?"</p><p>After just a glance at Three, who is still sleeping like a log on the floor, One shakes her head. "Leave her be. You'll more than do." <i>You'll more than do.</i> I hear the words again in my head. They make me happy. One appreciates me...</p><p>Of all my sisters, One is the brightest, and the most knowledgeable, and the most dependable. She is responsible and just. She might not be lovable like Two or beautiful like Three, but her every expression and gesture exudes wisdom. That's why she's my role model. I can't do anything about my face, but I can always get wiser.</p><p>Also, One has pancakes like me. For now, anyway.</p><p>"One, what do you need help with?" I ask as I walk a few steps behind her.</p><p>"Fixing a cart. I got us one at a nearby farm."</p><p>"A cart? What for?"</p><p>"There's something we'll need to carry once we get where we're going next." As I look at her in profile like this, the resolve on her face is pronounced. This is the expression she makes before going into battle. And we won't be doing it for ourselves. It will be for someone else: people who are suffering. One isn't the sort to turn a blind eye to injustice.</p><p>But sometimes I feel sorry for her when I see her like this; she has so many responsibilities. And she's not even the oldest of us, really. She's only in this position because she got sort of...bumped up the ladder, you might say. The truth is, One is someone's little sister, too. Someone else is supposed to be eldest and shoulder all this responsibility and tell us what to do...</p><p>"Um... Listen. You know I'm here to do everything I can to help you, right? You don't have to make every problem your own."</p><p>One seems a little surprised at first, but then her eyes soften and she replies, "Thank you." Two is unreliable, Three is weird, Five is selfish. That means I've got to help One. As dependable as she is, she's trying to fill the shoes of someone else, and that can't be easy.</p><p><i>Don't worry, I'll be there for you. That's what little sisters do. Well, at least this little sister. Right, One?</i></p><p>"Huh?" When I wake up, One is gone. The cart we were supposed to fix and the vacant house we had borrowed are gone, too. I'm in the same bed I always sleep in. "Oh...it was just a dream."</p><p>Of course it was. After all, we're all grown up now, and our journey is over. I used to think we could still go back to those days, when the five of us traveled together, but too much has changed.</p><p>I find myself wishing I dreamed of an older memory. One from way far back, when we had Zero, who was stronger and more beautiful than any of us. Back when I loved her, and admired her, and tried to be just like her.</p><p>But then, I still love her. She's my sister. She's family. I still believe she'll go back to the way she was so we can all live together again. So we can all be happy again.</p>And maybe I won't mind if there's one or two less of us.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

I don't have as big a heart as Two does; I could never claim that the world is full of things that I like. Honestly, there are too many things that I dislike. Nasty foods, ugly clothes, boring people...</p><p>But just because I don't like it doesn't mean I don't want it. I mean, what if that food isn't tasty because it isn't being cooked right? One time, Two wrestled with the stomach of a sandworm to make me an unbelievably delectable soup. I think she said she had to cure it in salt first before drying it in the sun, and then spent days stirring the pot as it stewed. Now, that was far more complicated a process than I would be willing to go to, but it proves that it's worth wanting.</p><p>You can make ugly clothes presentable with enough accessories. And boring people can turn out to be quite useful as servants. You have to make something your own to determine its true worth. Wouldn't you agree?</p><p>So I don't think there is anything in the world that I don't want. But there are things that I want just a little bit. And then there are things that I want <i>badly</i>.</p><p>What I want the most, of course, are pretty accessories, clothes, and shoes. I prefer gold over silver in my accessories. And lots of sparkling jewels! Like a walnut-sized sapphire brooch studded with tiny aquamarine and diamond pieces. Or an emerald-encrusted gold work necklace.</p><p>I like lace in the clothes that I wear. I almost passed out one time while trying on a robe made entirely of lace! I love lace in detachable collars, shawls, even handkerchiefs.</p><p>Apparently, it takes a lot of time and effort to make lace. Four told me that prices hike up with even just a little bit of lace around the edges.</p><p>"You could feed a poor family for days with the money you would spend on just one of these frilly things. Do you still want to keep playing dress-up like a little girl?"</p><p>Four always speaks the truth, like an older sister should. So I replied:</p><p>"You're right, Four. I don't need this dress anymore."</p><p>I was getting tired of that holey rag anyway.</p><p>My favorite right now is the one with lots of ribbons. Layered bow ties made of fine thin silk, all over the sleeves and torso! Isn't it adorable? I think I should make a decorative belt out of ribbon and squeeze it tight around my waist to highlight my magnificent bosom. Wouldn't that be a feast for the eyes?</p><p>I bet this dress covered in ribbons is expensive, too. How many days could this feed a poor family, I wonder.</p><p>But it's not as though these poor people would be able to stuff themselves if I stopped dressing up. Those issues are unrelated. Besides, I didn't pay for these dresses out of my pocket. They just <i>became</i> mine after we offed our former lord.</p><p>It was that lord that extorted money from people and then squandered it. It wasn't me.</p><p>Anyway, what should I wear today? The one with the ribbons? I love this dress with the damask folded in, too. The gold and silver threads really complement the color of my hair. Or maybe I should wear this one with sable fur around the hem and cuffs—</p><p>"Mmff... Five? You up already?"</p><p>Whose voice do I hear from directly behind me? My disciple's, of course. So cute. I love him so much. Poor thing, he sounds groggy.</p><p>"You can go back to sleep, Dito."</p><p>Young'uns need lots of sleep. Especially Dito because he stays up late every night.</p><p>"Not with the fuss you're making."</p><p>"Oh. So sorry."</p><p>"No worries."</p><p>I love the way he yawns and stretches loudly. He is so beautiful that I can barely contain myself. His face is like a doll.</p><p>And by doll, I don't mean like the toy soldiers that Three makes. I mean normal dolls. Cute girl dolls.</p><p>But Dito is so much cuter. Skin as white as snow, eyes twinkling like the brightest stars. His soft curls feel so airy through my fingers I could rub my hands over his head forever. I like Dito the most. Dito is my favorite toy.</p><p>"You're playing with your dresses again? So early in the morning? You're such a dork, Five."</p><p>I even like the way he mouths off. Maybe it's the element of surprise in hearing such venom being spouted from such an angelic face. I firmly believe that the key to every relationship between a man and a woman is unpredictability. I mean, wouldn't you rather your lover take on a completely different persona in bed?</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>"I have to get up as early as I can. A day goes by so fast," I say.</p><p>"Well, of course you'd run out of time when you're changing clothes four times a day. Why can't you just wear the same clothes until nighttime?"</p><p>"Perish the thought! With so many dresses, how could I wear but one a day?"</p><p>It's not as though circumstances don't allow me to change because I'm traveling, or because there is nothing else to wear. To keep the same clothes on when I have so many is simply unthinkable!</p><p>"Tell me, Dito: which dress do you think I should wear?"</p><p>I take the one with the ribbons, the one with the gold and silver threads, and the one with the fur edges, and place all three in front of him. But all he does is yawn.</p><p>"I don't care. They're your damned clothes."</p><p>The disinterest in his voice sounds almost convincing. It doesn't match his cherubic face. What could be eating at him? Oh, I get it!</p><p>"You just don't like dresses because they're a hassle to take off of me."</p><p>"No, that's not exactly—"</p><p>"You've been trying to tell me that you'd rather I wore nothing at all!"</p><p>"Not really, I just—"</p><p>"But I don't mind doing it fully clothed, you know."</p><p>"Now, wait a minute!"</p><p>"I'll just get on top. Or should I stand while you take me from behind?"</p><p>"Will you stop, please!?"</p><p>"Are you being coy with me? Or is that a backwards invitation?"</p><p>Maybe he really is hesitating. Dito is my disciple, after all. A disciple is enslaved by his Intoner. He is forbidden to go against my word. A disciple must perpetually serve the Intoner, day and night.</p><p>"There is no need to be shy, you know."</p><p>"This one! You wanted me to pick out a dress for you, right? Right!?"</p><p>Oh, Dito. His face is all red. Is he blushing? So adorable! Makes me want to squeeze him tight and pin him down on the floor.</p><p>"I like this one! The shiny number!"</p><p>"Forget the dress, Dito. Let's—"</p><p>"Oh, wait, wait! There's one you haven't tried yet. Remember, with the embroidery? The blue, flowery one?"</p><p>He's right. There was a rather unique blue one with flowers stitched in. And I hadn't tried it on yet.</p><p>"Stay here, Five! I'll go get the dress!"</p><p>He slips out of my arms like a cat. But why does have to leap off the bed and dash like one? I'm not the type of master that gets upset just because you're slow to fetch a dress.</p><p>I thought I heard a heavy sigh from the wardrobe, but that couldn't have been Dito. Like he is an impeccable disciple to me, I am an impeccable Intoner to Dito.</p><p>Dito walks back in, dutifully carrying the blue dress. I open it up in front of the mirror. A form-fitting glossy blue garment with finely embroidered flowers. So exotic. So bold!</p><p>Yes, I like this, too! With every step, my legs show from the deep cuts up the sides. Definitely not to Four's liking. She would probably call it tasteless.</p><p>"This is pretty. But that doesn't mean the other ones aren't. What's a girl to do?"</p><p>I already had the one with the ribbons, the one with the damask, and the one with the fur to choose from. And now this flowery blue dress, too? There is no way I can choose just one!</p><p>"I wish I had three or four bodies. Then I could wear them all at once!"</p><p>"Three or four bodies? Of YOU? Are you serious?"</p><p>"Of course I am."</p><p>"...That would be a nightmare."</p><p>Dito looks as though the world is coming to an end. I wonder what could have crossed his mind.</p><p>"I think it's a fabulous idea. Let's ask One if she knows any spells that can create three bodies of me."</p><p>Big sister One is always holed up in the vault underneath the church reading difficult books. I wouldn't be surprised at all if she knew a spell or two of the sort.</p><p>"If I had three bodies, I wouldn't have to ponder over which dress to wear. Why, I could even eat three times more."</p><p>"You already eat three times what you should."</p><p>"What? That's not true."</p><p>Sure, I have a hearty appetite. I don't like feeling hungry. Hunger makes me feel lonely. That's why I eat before I start feeling hungry.</p><p>But that doesn't mean I eat three times as much as a normal person. Dito has that mischievous grin. Mmm, I love that look on him.</p><p>"Whenever the cooks ask you if you want meat or fish, you always answer both."</p><p>"But, Dito, that would only be two times as much, not three."</p><p>Besides, if they ask me to choose one of two dishes, it has to mean they're ready either way. They wouldn't ask me that way if they weren't. Which leads me to think, if they're both available, why not have both?</p><p>"How about if they offered broiled meat, stewed meat, or steamed meat? You would say all of them."</p><p>"Well, yes, if that's the way they phrased the question."</p><p>"What if they asked you if you wanted broiled fish, steamed fish or fried fish?"</p><p>"All of them, I guess. And now you're making me hungry. I wonder if breakfast is ready yet."</p><p>"See? Your appetite is <i>more</i> than triple the norm, Five."</p><p>I really don't think my appetite is to blame. It's the pure fact that there is so much deliciousness in existence. As much as a gourmet as I am, I couldn't possibly ask for something that doesn't even exist.</p><p>But if I <i>do</i> know it exists, and it's out of my reach, I would chase it to the edges of the world.</p><p>Oh, I do love going on trips in search of good eats. It's far more thrilling than having to go hunt down some evil man, or to vanquish a monster or some other nasty thing. I tell Dito:</p><p>"I can't wait for springtime. Then we can go on one of our gourmet trips again."</p><p>"You mean the nasty beasty feasts?"</p><p>"But in Two's hands, any beast can turn into a scrumptious meal."</p><p>"Aha! Then you don't deny them being beasts?"</p><p>"Oh, there's no doubt they're beasts. But only Two can turn gobin brains into a silky pâté. Sting lizard in aspic, pickled six-eyed catfish... You can't these things just anywhere."</p><p>"They are rare, um, delicacies, I suppose."</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"It's not every day you have to risk your life for a meal. I certainly wish I never have to."</p><p>Oh, my. Dito. That cocky look. And the way those shoulders go up when you shrug. Now you've done it. Bad, bad boy.</p><p>"Um... Five?"</p><p>And <i>that</i> look. The uncomfortable look. It just makes me want to make him even more uncomfortable.</p><p>"You're not having any...wicked thoughts, are you, now?"</p><p>"Wicked? Heavens, no."</p><p>The way he looks up at me with those frightened pupils. He's almost like a little bunny. Mmm, and there's another fine delicacy. Rabbit meat. Stewed for hours until it's so tender it melts in your mouth. Serve it with a sweet sauce made of fruit.</p><p>"D-Didn't you say you were hungry? H-How about some b-breakfast?"</p><p>"Yes, I'll have some right now."</p><p>"Wait. Please wait, Five—"</p><p>"No. I can't wait. Don't you know me by now?"</p><p>He looked like he had more to say, but what he says doesn't really matter. Not when I'm <i>on</i>. I can't hold it back anymore. My sweet, sweet disciple. My one and only hunny-bunny. Where should I start eating?</p><p>"Why does this have to happen so early in the morning?"</p><p>"It's because of those sleepy eyes of yours, Dito."</p><p>"What you're saying doesn't match up with what you're doing."</p><p>"But don't you enjoy snoozing in my bosom?"</p><p>Even his moans are lovely. Though one could mistake them for sighs. They can't be sighs.</p><p>For all the effort and creativity I put into this, I see no reason to tolerate complaints. I try a great many things not just for my own pleasure, but for the pleasure of my partners, too.</p><p>I believe one should put in an honest effort before blaming others for an unsatisfactory experience. You can read books or talk to people. You name it, I've done it.</p><p>You can even try different partners. Luckily for me, I have plenty of partners to choose from. Men and women, even multiple partners in one night. It could very well be that there's nothing wrong with you, but that it's just a matter of chemistry.</p><p>But chemistry can be tricky. It is awfully hard to find someone who can truly impress. But I am not about to give up. Because this can't be as good as it gets. It has to be so much better.</p><p>And when I learn something really good, I'm going to share it with Dito. Because he is my precious disciple.</p><p>"No, wait... Not yet...!"</p><p>Oops. I guess I got a bit distracted. I'm sorry, Dito. Don't sigh like that. It's okay, really.</p><p>"Sweet Dito. There's no need to make such a face."</p><p>We can just have another go at it! As many times as we want. Right?</p><p>"Five, you have the appetite of three people, but the libido of thirty."</p><p>"Why, thank you for the wonderful compliment."</p><p>"...It wasn't a compliment."</p><p>"Such a good little man. You deserve a reward. Where do you want it?"</p><p>"Sounds more like I'm about to be punished than rewarded."</p><p>"Oh! So is that what you're into?"</p><p>I had no idea. To each his own, as they say. That explains why he looks so bored sometimes. Why didn't he tell me sooner? I don't mind putting in the effort and creativity, but I also think it is wiser to avoid wasting time on detours.</p><p>With the world so full of things that I want, I don't have a moment to spare. So many beautiful clothes to try on! So much delicious foods to sample! I don't want to even waste time sleeping.</p><p>"Why do you have to be so greedy?" asks Dito.</p><p>Greedy? Me?</p><p>I don't think that's entirely accurate. I think my desire for things is a reflection of the need to feel how powerful I am.</p><p>In those moments where I finally wrap my hands around something I have really wanted, the euphoria is instant and orgasmic. Feelings like superiority and omnipotence rush out in waves from the deepest parts of my being. <i>Nothing</i> feels better than having the power to obtain what I desire.</p><p>If I didn't have that power, I don't know if I would want anything. How sad would it be to want something but not be able to get it? Why, I imagine life would be a miserable waste to pursue something that is impossible to obtain.</p><p>But one does wonder... What if there is such a thing? I can't even imagine what it might be, but I supposed there could be something that I could never, ever have.</p><p>With my hand on my heart, I begin to think...maybe there is. Something I have not noticed until now. I don't even know whether I want it or not, but it's something devoid of excess or grandeur.</p><p>What could it be?</p><p>It can't be food. And it's probably not jewelry or clothing. If it were any of those things, I could easily get my hands on it.</p><p>Is it a person? But I have plenty of servants and handmaids at my beck and call. I even have soldiers who would risk their lives for me. Men? No shortage there, either. I know of no man who could resist my advances. Unless he were my own father or something. Father... Daddy...?</p><p>"Five? Are you all right?"</p><p>"Huh...?"</p><p>Gone. I could almost make it out...but it's gone.</p><p>"This is new. I've never seen you so lost in thought while in bed."</p><p>"Well, isn't that rude? I'll have you know I am perfectly capable of having deep thoughts."</p><p>"Did I make you mad?"</p><p>"Not at all."</p><p>In fact, maybe he did me a favor by chasing away <i>that</i> particular silhouette.</p><p>There is no way I could remember my father. He died not long after I was born. To try to recall something that I have no way of knowing would be an utter waste of time.</p><p>So no more losing myself in deep thoughts. Who cares about what I can't get? I just want to keep thinking about all the things that I love. The sapphire brooch, and the emerald and gold work necklace. The dress with the ribbons, and the dress with the flowers. The robe and shawl and the detachable collar with lace.</p><p>"Now, where were we?"</p><p>And my sweet, sweet disciple.</p><p>"What? Again!?"</p><p>"I'm only kidding."</p><p>I really am hungry now. Let's have breakfast. How about some soft-boiled eggs on toasted bread, with smoked fish and pickled vegetables? And the dried fruits preserved in honey. Oh, but I must decide on what to wear before that. Speaking of which, I think there was a dress with the cuffs as long as drapes. And where did the red woolen one go?</p><p>These are the things that make me happy! I just need to keep thinking about the things that I want, and things that I really want. And not think about anything else.</p>How could any body be happier?<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

I felt the rise of an unexpected laugh. As if sunny days were any better.<br/><br/></p><p>"What is it?" a voice next to me asked, weakly. It was so frail that the rain threatened to wash it away.<br/><br/></p><p>"What is what?" I replied, and wished I hadn't. People who answered questions with questions disgusted me. I used to make sure they never answered anyone again. Every time.<br/><br/></p><p>"I can hear you crying."<br/><br/></p><p>"You're mistaken. That was a laugh." I couldn't blame her. How could she have read my expression? They had taken her sight; pried open both her lids and thrust needles into each eye. And that was not the only torture she had endured. Repeated burns from a branding iron had reduced her palms and the soles of her feet to rotted, reeking flesh, and the joints of all four limbs had been ruined to the point where she couldn't even turn in her sleep.<br/><br/></p><p>I won't stop here and lament that people are willing to do something so brutal to a girl of so few years. I practically expect it from landed lords, or else why would she and her friends have tried to start a revolt in the first place? The damned fools.<br/><br/></p><p>And it was foolish. They were found before they could even pick up their weapons, let alone revolt. Sold out by one of their own. That's what you get for trusting other people. There is no such thing as a person incapable of betrayal.<br/><br/></p><p>The five masterminds were caught and tortured. I heard they were promised release if they coughed up the details of the plot and the names of those party to it, which was obviously a load of shit. But gullible people can't learn not to be duped.<br/><br/></p><p>That said, the stubborn ones like her who held out were given the same mangling as the ones who confessed immediately, and all were laid out here, onto the cobblestones of the square. Being clever didn't earn anyone a better outcome. Their lord may not have treated them fairly, but he did treat them equally.<br/><br/></p><p>If any one thing could be called unequal, it was that five fine souls who tried to strike down an oppressive lord were chained up here next to a common murderer like me. There was no making sense of that one. I wasn't tortured the way they were. I had no grand scheme or friends to give up. Since I had nothing to confess, no one shattered my bones or ripped my fingernails off. All I got was a vicious lashing.<br/><br/></p><p>The pain, which had felt like flames leaping across my back, was gone now. There was no sensation left. The cold rain must have been nipping at my back, but I felt no chill. Knowing it meant my death was near made it no less strange. "What a waste of life." There was no stopping the laughter now. I couldn't remember a single good day, rain or shine. My life had been hell from as far back as I could remember, and undoubtedly from the first moment I came into the world.<br/><br/></p><p>My earliest memory is of my mother shouting, and the only other thing I remember from those days is being slapped around. I doubt I was fed well, either. After all, I learned to swipe a meal before I even learned to speak. If she'd been feeding me properly, I wouldn't have been forced to steal.<br/><br/></p><p>My mother shouldn't be singled out as a bad person. Only a handful of kids were lucky enough to have warm food and a bed. Unless you were born into some fancy noble household, you could kiss any hope of a life like that goodbye. You wondered why the hell you were born, grew up knowing you were a thorn in the world's side, turned into a shitty adult, and then unwittingly wound up with a bun in the oven. That was it for most women. My mother did nothing more than raise me the best way she knew.<br/><br/></p><p>Once I reached an acceptable age, my mother sold me without a second thought—for a pittance, when I thought back on it later. As was the way, I was sold to a brothel, where women who looked a lot like my mother attended to men with tight purse strings.<br/><br/></p><p>It wasn't all older women; there were girls there my age. I became fast friends with one. She called me "Rose," which was how I learned the color of my eyes. "Haven't you ever looked in a mirror? she asked in surprise when I told her. Of course not. I couldn't have cared less what I looked like.<br/><br/></p><p>I decided she should be called "Indigo." As little as I cared about my own face, I realized her eyes were a pretty color. Rose and Indigo: they were names that belonged only to us.<br/><br/></p><p>One day, Indigo suggested we steal some money and run away. I nodded, believing that together, the two of us could do anything. I never stopped to think about where we would run or what we would do after.<br/><br/></p><p>The plan went off brilliantly; we took as much money as we could carry, and fled out of town and across the bridge to the far side of the river. There was a man waiting there with a horse. I had seen him before; he was a patron who hung all over Indigo. "If we make it across the river, everything will work out," she had said, and now things were starting to click.<br/><br/></p><p>I thought for certain they would take me with them; how utterly wrong I was. They had planned to kill me all along. Indigo could only carry so much money by herself; that was why she'd approached me. The only reason. "No hard feelings, Rose." And then she grinned. It was the same smile as always, but then I knew. Underneath it had been a girl who was figuring out how to kill me. Took me long enough to see it.<br/><br/></p><p>If the pursuers hadn't come right then, my life would have been over. The other two galloped off in a hurry, and I alone was caught.<br/><br/></p><p>I never resented Indigo for it. Rather, I was rankled by my own witlessness. Why did I trust another person? Of course it was my fault, for being fooled. If things had played out differently, Indigo and that man would be the ones lying dead by the river, and I'd have been the one to get away. Next time, I thought, I'll do better.<br/><br/></p><p>My chance came several months later. I took the gold and got away with ease; I might have even put Indigo to shame. To keep pursuers off my back, I slaughtered everyone: the procurers, their underlings, the women. It wasn't hard. All I had to do was wait until they were sound asleep, then end them one by one.<br/><br/></p><p>I killed the procurers first; next, the men they'd hired to do the dirty work. Thanks to the poison I'd thrown into the casks, they were half dead already. Even with my meager strength, it wasn't hard to finish off men who had already ceased moving. Once the men were taken care of, work went fast. Women never smell blood. Torrents of the stuff were flowing right by their side, but not one opened her eyes or let out a scream before expiring.<br/><br/></p><p>I took as much money as I could carry and left town before dawn. Of course, no pursuers came, but worse news did: bandits. They captured me handily and gleefully relieved me of every coin I had. And though they spared my life, I again felt the sting of failure.<br/><br/></p><p>I waited for my chance and escaped before they could sell me back into whoring. This time, thievery was out of the question. I knew I would be better off not trying to carry off their money. Any coin I had would just be stolen. If I needed something, I didn't have to buy it; I could take it. No one could rob from me if I had nothing to steal.<br/><br/></p><p>I did have one thing they wanted, though: myself. The bandits were ready to sell me, just as my mother had sold me; as a woman, I would always be someone's spoil. But that was beyond my control; I could not discard my womanhood or leave it behind. I suppose I could have made Indigo's choice and found a man to protect me. But people lie; people betray. I didn't want their protection. I would protect myself.<br/><br/></p><p>Wait. But I did live with a man. Just one, just once. I ran into one of that sleazy brothel's patrons. It was some place far away, in some unfamiliar town. He remembered my face; I remembered his. I have to kill him, was my first thought. The procurers and the women were dead—all of them except for me. He wasn't so witless that he couldn't piece together what that meant. But, for whatever reason, I didn't do it. Instead, we found a corner of that unfamiliar town and started a life.<br/><br/></p><p>He wasn't witless, but neither could you call him honest; he was a thief with a talent for picking locks. Together, we raked in the coin and passed the days with amusement. As a life, it wasn't bad, and thoughts of killing him slipped away.<br/><br/></p><p>The life didn't last long, though. I got sick. A scourge was going around. Slowly but inexorably it eroded the body and killed you. Not only that, it was contagious. Fearing for his life, the man left me. I don't blame him, and if it had ended there I would have let him go. But he was going to sell me out; a bounty had been placed on the "brigand" who had broken into the brothel.<br/><br/></p><p>What a fool. I had only just caught the scourge and my symptoms were still mild. I struggled to get up in the morning, got chills in the evening, broke into fits of severe coughing... But that was it. Nothing that would interfere with me taking a life.<br/><br/></p><p>Thus, I had no trouble reversing our fates when he came in my sleep to tie me up. The scourge had turned me into a light sleeper—and either way, I had a certain sensitivity to lethal intent. Before I could think, I had opened his gullet, and he died with the confusion still written on his face.<br/><br/></p><p>It was only then that I realized I'd never really let him into my life. Despite sleeping and eating with him, telling myself I was over killing him, it wasn't true. Otherwise, I wouldn't have constantly kept a blade hidden within reach.<br/><br/></p><p>And so, I was alone again. I journeyed aimlessly, filching food and clothes as I went. As I mentioned, the scourge was taking its time with me, so it was well within my ability to travel and plunder and kill. I murdered the owners of my spoils on the spot, women or elderly included.<br/><br/></p><p>Again and again I would hear, "Take the food and the money. Just spare my life. Please." It's strange; everyone makes the same face when death is close. Did I look at Indigo the same way? No, I never begged.<br/><br/></p><p>"Suppose I do spare you. You're certain to hold this against me. You'll come for me one day."<br/><br/></p><p>"I would never—"<br/><br/></p><p>"Never let it go, right? I just butchered your mother right in front of you." And unlike mine, this one must have been a good mother, considering she had thrust herself in harm's way to protect her daughters. "Anyway, I'd apologize for this, but that would only serve to make myself feel better, and I'm not that deluded." With that, I killed the two trembling sisters while they still clung to each other. No doubt they hated me in those last moments, but they would never come after me with a knife.<br/><br/></p><p>There were some who didn't beg. One was a girl a few years my junior. Rage flared in her eyes as she lay into me. "Why!?" Why would you do this?"<br/><br/></p><p>"Maybe because I'm hungry."<br/><br/></p><p>"How dare you mock me!"<br/><br/></p><p>"No one's mocking anyone. I'm starving, and don't have the coin for food."<br/><br/></p><p>"And you think that justifies this!?" Her father's and brother's bodies lay there in front of her. A bit further away was a woman who appeared to have been their cook. I always dealt with potential threats first, which meant I got stuck with children and elderly last. "You could have simply taken our gold and left!"<br/><br/></p><p>"Yeah. You know, you're right. I used to think it was about keeping people from seeking vengeance, but I'm starting wonder if that's really it. Why do I do it?" But I had already strangled her before I could finish expressing my reservations. Her eyes were still wide when she took her last breath, still red with anger. "I wish I could tell you."<br/><br/></p><p>I felt her gaze on my back as I took a loaf from the table. I hadn't been lying when I said I was starving. The whole reason I had picked this house was because the family looked rich. And since it was suppertime, food would be waiting to fill my belly. I had a good reason. But again, I wondered aloud: "Why?" I took food from the plates with my bare hands and washed it down with a swig from the decanter. My compliments to the chef.<br/><br/></p><p>"Why do I do it? Shouldn't I know after this many?" I posed the question to the girl's limp body on the floor. I hadn't been keeping count; I didn't think it mattered. All I knew was that I had killed a lot of people. And yet I couldn't answer one simple question: Why do I do it?<br/><br/></p><p>"Maybe I kill to find out why." The girl's dead eyes continued to glare at me. I guess it wasn't a good enough answer.<br/><br/></p><p>I continued to live like that for some time. Before I knew it, I had stopped searching for reasons or answers; I robbed people and killed them as easily as I drew breath.<br/><br/></p><p>The thing is, I entered public awareness around the time my kills reached triple digits. I had done my best to finish off everyone in the homes I breached and leave no evidence, but then again, I hadn't gone out of my way to be secretive, so I suppose I got made at some point.<br/><br/></p><p>My days became numbered once word got out about the young woman behind the merciless killings of young and old. Descriptions of my appearance circulated and merchants spread word during their travels. Soon every town in every land was searching for the "witch with eyes of rose." The bounty for my capture would pay for a life at ease, and proper rewards were promised for even a decent lead.<br/><br/></p><p>And so I was caught. They surrounded me while the scourge was doing its work on me. By then, the symptoms had started taking their toll, and I was unable to resist, let alone escape. Soldiers in grand armor made an even grander fuss of binding me hand and foot.<br/><br/></p><p>My gamble—that the scourge would kill me first—had been wrong, and I was dragged off to the bastille. They condemned me to the lash; I would be struck once for each life I took. Personally, I think I toughed it out rather well; they whipped me until my skin was in tatters and my flesh split, but I survived. Then again, if they had gotten my kill count right, I would have died for certain. Their tally came up woefully short, and so my punishment ended well before it could be called capital.<br/><br/></p><p>Of course, that didn't mean I was forgiven. They chained me up to die in the square, along with the five rebels. Directly next to me was the young girl I mentioned earlier. While the others no longer uttered so much as a groan, she continued her one assertion: "What we did was right." But her voice was growing ever fainter. When the lot was dragged out here, she was in the most miserable state. I could tell that she was keeping herself alive through sheer power of will alone.<br/><br/></p><p>I took advantage of her lack of sight and stared her up and down without reservation. Here was more or less my complete opposite: a girl whose sense of justice was hopelessly unswayable. The fact that we stood in this place shoulder to shoulder struck me as strange beyond words. Eventually, she inquired as to who I was. It was my fault for coughing; the scourge's distinctive and disagreeable bark gave me away as not being one of her friends. "Who are you? What's your name?"<br/><br/></p><p>"I don't have a name," I answered. "I don't have anything. No coin, no house, no family or friends or lover. Nothing at all. I give 'nothing' new depths. All I have is this life which is about to blink out along with everything else. I wound up with zero. Jack shit."<br/><br/></p><p>Because I did shit away my life. I lived empty day after empty day without purpose. It was so stupid in retrospect that I found myself laughing uncontrollably.<br/><br/></p><p>"Don't cry," the voice said.<br/><br/></p><p>"I told you...I'm laughing."<br/><br/></p><p>I was struggling so hard to breathe that it must have come out as spasms. Like any of those next breaths could have been my last.<br/><br/></p><p>"Really?"<br/><br/></p><p>"Yes."<br/><br/></p><p>I heard what might have been a sigh. The rain had finally eased into a drizzle. A moment later, her body convulsed for a few fleeting seconds, and then she stopped moving entirely.<br/><br/></p><p>"Hey..."<br/><br/></p><p>No answer.<br/><br/></p><p>"So, I guess it'll be me." It had been decided the last to survive would be burned alive with the bodies of the other five. One of the group bit her own tongue off when she heard. Another was dead by the time the bunch was dragged out to the square. Another died before the rain came, and a fourth during the downpour, leaving me and the girl.<br/><br/></p><p>Good luck burning me in this weather. Maybe they would try burying me alive with them instead. At least we can all take solace in the fact she wasn't the last to go. It wouldn't have been right if the one girl who had shown compassion for others right to the end had to die the worst.<br/><br/></p><p>But what was right? Who was right?<br/><br/></p><p>I could hear the girl's voice again: What we did was right. And it was. Only the world could be called wrong—this world full of lords who shit on their people, this world with smug murderers like me. This world where those who stand up on behalf of the weak are crushed like so many worms.<br/><br/></p><p>This is madness. It doesn't make any sense. Ire filled me all at once.<br/><br/></p><p>No. It had always been there and I just hadn't noticed. I hated the world. I had damned it in my mind since before I could remember. I could feel the tremor of a scream in my throat. Glurp. Something warm dribbled from my mouth. It was blood, not a scream. This fucking world is trying to kill me. Fuck that. Fuck the world! Fuck you all! YOU fucking die! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!<br/><br/></p><p>Then, all of a sudden, I noticed a flower. A rose-colored flower was blossoming right before my eyes, between me and the girl's corpse. Where did it come from? I don't remember seeing a flower there. It swayed beneath the rain's blows. The flower must have been new to me, and yet I recognized it. Maybe because its color is so like my eyes. Or maybe I'm already dead, and this is one of those flowers that's supposed to grow in Paradise.<br/><br/></p><p>No. Heaven won't have anything to do with me. I'm dying, and this is a hallucination. But that's all right. I still want to see it up close. I want to touch it. No one has ever given me a flower, and I've never longed for one. But this flower, I love.<br/><br/></p><p>I felt something constricting my sight. I wasn't able to shut my eyes, so I kept gazing at the flower. It was so lovely... My life may have been wasted, but this was not such a terrible final thing to behold.<br/><br/></p>As its widening petals filled my field of vision, I greeted the flower with a quiet smile.<p class="mw-empty-elt"/></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Sarafa"><a href="#Sarafa" class="headerlink" title="Sarafa"></a>Sarafa</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>I have been bound for all of my days. Bound to a dazzling prison others name a palace. My elegant fetters are contained in the title of princess. Only once, in my youth, did I comprehend freedom.</p><p>When I was young, I grew tired of my stuffy life in the palace and impulsively fled. For the first time, I walked the nighttime streets of the city, where a fantastical atmosphere welcomed me with open arms.</p><p>I walked and walked until I no longer knew where I was.</p><p>I couldn’t see the palace, or even the mighty spire atop it. Loneliness overcame me then, causing tears to tremble in the corners of my eyes.</p><p>“Is something troubling you, young lady?” said the voice of an old woman from somewhere behind me. Relieved that help had finally arrived, I suddenly burst out weeping. So loud was my wailing that all those walking the streets stopped to look. But the old woman gently took my hand and led me away. She led me to her home—a small domicile where she told the fortunes of others.</p><p>Crystals glowed faintly. Exotic rugs tickled my feet. I cannot remember the fortune she scried for me…</p><p>But I will never forget the shock that pierced my heart in that moment.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I eventually came to love the night. One reason—perhaps the most important—was that I could escape the palace and find new sides of myself. The day I met the old woman, I made of her a request:</p><p>“Please make me your apprentice and teach me to divine futures.”</p><p>Though she agreed, her teachings were harsh. “People place their lives in the hands of fortunes,” she would say. Under her strict tutelage, I gleaned the secrets of divination. Eventually, I began to perform readings for others under her watchful eye. I was cautious: If ever I saw a bad result, I worded it in a way that sounded positive. In the palace, I yearned for night. In the old woman’s house, I divined futures. For a time, this was my life.</p><p>One day, when the old woman was away, a redheaded couple came to have their fortunes told. I was overconfident by then, and thought I could do it without her help. As the crystal ball sparked to life, I witnessed a catastrophic future. And I found I did not have the words to change it.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>A rumor drew a crowd to the bay. A man and woman fought over the end of their relationship, and the woman ended up drowning the man. The woman had short, striking red hair. Red hair was unusual in this nation. I realized at once she was the same woman whose fortune I had told. </p><p>That was when I knew: I had the power to manipulate the lives of others through divination. To that point, I had nothing in my life save the title of “princess.” But now? Now I had a secret power.</p><p>All that awaited me, however, was the old woman’s rage. She blamed me for warping the fates of others through my inexperience. All my excuses fell on deaf ears, and she threw me from her home. The last thing she said to me was this:</p><p>“You have no right to tell the fortune of another.”</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Days later, as the sun dawned on the city, another crowd gathered. They were a mob, and they ripped the old woman’s house down with their own hands. They screamed and trampled the remains, destroying everything. The old woman’s prized divination tools were buried beneath the rubble. </p><p>And I watched. And I smiled.</p><p>I struggled to keep back the laughter bubbling in my throat. I had used my powers selfishly to unleash the mob. For even after she sent me away, I continued to foretell the future. I could not find the strength to stop. I worked quietly, propped up alone in a dark back alley. I told fortunes. I turned people into my playthings. I could never go back. Because the day I ripped that couple apart, I felt something new. That realization? That I could change someone’s fate?</p><p>It was deep. Powerful. Distorted.<br>It was<br>.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Back when the woman used to have her smile…</p><p>A small country lies nestled between dry sand and fertile sea, its capital an assortment of haphazardly placed spires and domed rooves.</p><p>“Before it sits a vast desert, one that claims the lives of any who might threaten the city.”</p><p>“Behind it lies a vast ocean, one where ships laden with precious cargo from across the world come and go.”</p><p>Within the capital, there is a palace. Within the palace, there is a corridor. And dashing through the corridor, there is a single girl. Though she runs with wild abandon, none dare scold her. For she is the country’s princess.</p><p>“Mother!” she cries as she bursts into a room. “You called for me!?”</p><p>The room boasts high ceilings and cool breezes reminiscent of the finest desert resort. Finely-crafted furniture fills every corner. The person the girl calls “mother” lays claim to this place, as well as the rest of the country. She is queen of this land; all of its prosperity flows to her.</p><p>“I did call you,” the queen begins. “For today, I would speak with you of marriage.” She hands the princess a scroll. Written at its top is the name of a country the princess does not recognize. As well as a terrifying phrase:<br>marriage of state<br>. </p><p>As royalty, the princess lacks the right to choose her husband. And though she knew this moment was coming, she cannot hide her concern.</p><p>“Worry not,” says the queen as she senses her daughter’s unease. “I have selected a most excellent partner.”</p><p>Memories from her life come rushing back to the princess. She recalls conversations with her beloved mother, as well as her secret life as a fortune teller—a thing of which only her lady-in-waiting is aware. It had all taken place here, in this land betwixt sand and sea. As tears well in the girl’s eyes, the queen pulls her into an embrace.</p><p>“All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter’s happiness.” The tears are loosed now, flowing down her face and onto the uncaring marble below. But the girl knows her mother has her best interests at heart. And in that moment, it is enough.</p><p>A lengthy procession snakes through silvery, moonlit sands. The princess’s procession. She sits inside her litter, surrounded before and behind by a wealth of effusive gifts personally selected by her mother the queen. Bored, she gazes out through a mesh-covered window at the brilliant night sky. She is heading for a land rich in ore and precious metals. Her mother has long desired such things, and hopes that marrying her daughter to the country’s ruling family will allow her to secure them under advantageous conditions. But first, the princess must earn the king’s fancy and prove to his ministers that she is an asset of value. It will be difficult, time-consuming work. But the girl is confident. For she is particularly adept at reading the hearts of others and manipulating them to her liking. She has spent many a long night wandering the city in the guise of a fortune teller, and such pursuits for people’s true essences should prove useful here.</p><p>Nerve. Curiosity. Ambition. These things and more well within her as she sits inside her litter and watches the breaking dawn.</p><p>Finally, the procession reaches its destination. The princess is hurried off to an astonishingly vast room so she might prepare for her wedding. She is dressed in a spotless white dress stitched with brilliant gold thread that catches the light. The army of maids who surround her swoon and sigh at the sight. But what captures the princess’s heart is not the gorgeous dress, but the shape of the city against the horizon. For the buildings outside her window shine even more brilliantly than her dress. Unlike her gritty, sand-covered home, this city is a land enveloped in white, dreamlike beauty.</p><p>Suddenly, the door swings wide, causing the maids to immediately bow their heads. “Ah, my new wife. At last we meet.”</p><p>The princess looks up to see a handsome, bearded man in the prime of his life. He is the king—the ruler of this land, and the man who would be her husband. Taking her hand, the king leads her to a courtyard facing the palace. Waiting there is a large portable shrine, as well as a sea of citizens.</p><p>“Welcome to our nation,” says the king as the people burst into a raucous cheer. Dancing petals fill her vision. Music swirls around her. In every corner of the courtyard, people are drinking and dancing with wanton abandon.</p><p>“Hail the new queen!”</p><p>“Long life to our new queen!”</p><p>“Pray look this way, Queen!”</p><p>Princess and king sit in the portable shrine as it begins slowly making its way down the crowded city streets. Today the girl begins a new life in this dazzling land. A place where everyone receives her with warmth and grace. Any doubts she harbored about earning the love of the king and his people quickly fall away. She will give her life to this land—for her mother’s sake as well as her own. She will live with the handsome king beside her and do all she can to see her new people happy. With a small nod, she makes peace with her decision.</p><p>“Attention, everyone!” cries the king suddenly. “It is time for today’s entertainment!”</p><p>The mood of the people immediately turns from excitement to frenzy. With one hand still gently grasping the princess’s own, the king receives an axe from one of his retainers. The polished blade reflects the sunlight. The worn handle is blackened with dirt.</p><p>“What are you going to do?” asks the bemused princess. “It is time you learned how we enjoy ourselves in this land,” he responds. Together, they step down from the shrine and into the sea of people. He swings the axe. Once. Twice. Again. With each swing, a citizen’s head soars away into the air, followed by a brilliant fountain of blood. The princess hears no screams. No panic. All is naught but blood and fevered cheers. The brilliant, unspoiled plaza is soon dyed the deepest crimson. The princess’s beautiful white dress is bright vermilion. She screams, then, a sound lost amidst the revelry.</p><p>“Onward, my queen!” cries the king as he leads her through the crowd swinging his gore-soaked axe. Whether she follows him by choice or force is a question she cannot answer. Her every movement is greeted with a shower of blood, one more step along the path of a wedding most bloody. She suddenly feels her carefully crafted plans wither and die inside her. Those she had manipulated in her life were normal people. Easy people. The type who might come to a fortune teller for advice. But the handsome king she is to marry is something altogether different. He is a man cruel beyond all measure. A man whose senses have abandoned him. And as the people of this mad king eagerly die before him with grins plastered across their faces…</p><p>The princess can only look on in horror.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A small kingdom lies nestled between sand and sea. The princess of this kingdom was sent to a faraway land and married off so her beloved mother might find greater prosperity. But to her horror, her new husband is a bloodthirsty, mad king who slaughtered his own people for entertainment at their wedding.</p><p>Days after the bloody ceremony, the woman stares out the window with haunted eyes. The king has given her a vast room with a stunning view. Its massive windows look out over the plaza where the wedding took place. There, people chat idly, lazing about beneath the gentle rays of the sun. The king bathed the floors and walls of the plaza with blood on that day of the frenzied feast. But now, all has been returned to normal, the red walls and floors painted white once more. She recalls what a retainer said to her about the paint:</p><p>“Aye, my new queen. It’s made from ash, as well as shells harvested from the nearby waters.”</p><p>She looks out across the country again. The high castle walls, the floors, and the houses are all covered in that same spotless white. She understands now why that is. For her new husband—the land’s king—engages in his bloody hobby on an almost daily basis. She tears her gaze away from the plaza, ready to enjoy a quiet moment to herself. But her reverie is interrupted by the pealing of a bell. It rings once. Twice. A third time. This bell sits at the highest point of the city and can be heard for miles. Its ringing is how the king summons her. She quickly readies herself and makes her way to his side.</p><p>She finds him in a circular arena at the center of the palace—a place where fighting tournaments are held.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you, my beautiful new queen!” he says as he scoops her into an embrace and deposits her in the empty seat beside him. She has been summoned here so she might watch the upcoming battle. Two stout and scarred men stand in the arena. The king takes great joy in such events; he makes them pummel each other until one lies dead, then strikes down the winner with his own hand. But the woman cannot revel in such an abattoir, and so looks away. Her eyes alight on a spire that stands outside the palace. Blood clings to its sides like thick honey. The day prior, the king had amused himself by gathering people at the spire while he skewered criminals atop it. Even the worst slavers and criminals would find such acts unthinkable in the princess’s homeland. But here, they are commonplace. Games, even.</p><p>He is mad<br> she thinks.<br>He is<br> utterly<br>mad<br>.</p><p>How did he possibly trick my mother into accepting this marriage?</p><p>Without warning, the king gently squeezes the princess’s hand, leaning his handsome face close to her own.</p><p>“I hope you are enjoying the game,” he whispers into her ear. Such “games” are naught but means to toy with the lives of others. Whenever he indulges himself in one, he calls her to his side. He drags her from one bloodbath to the next, just as he did at the wedding. And as she gazes at the mighty walls that protect this gorgeous land, a thought occurs to her:</p><p>This country is beautiful.</p><p>Yet it is nothing but a trap to lure in prey—an inescapable prison.</p><p>As the sun sets and shadows stretch across the city, the princess is finally freed from her husband’s latest amusement. She is beginning to feel herself growing numb to the daily parade of tragedies that unfold before her. It is a realization that<br>terrifies<br> her. Only here, in her own room, can she manage to find a sense of calm.</p><p>A full moon hangs in the sky. She steps onto the balcony, gazes up at the sky, and thinks of her home. Of her mother. As this country’s new queen, she has been treated most excellently. But her days are also filled with loneliness—and pain. Every one of the attendants who accompanied her on her journey has been slaughtered. She is utterly alone. But she will carry on. It is her duty to her country. To her mother. As that thought crosses her mind, she finds herself briefly refreshed. She whirls on one heel and makes to return to the room. But before she can move, she notices a faint mark on the wall. It would be invisible if not for the light of the full moon. She follows in the direction it points and finds herself facing one of her bedposts. She reaches behind the post until she feels something solid.</p><p>A diary.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of her bed, she begins to read. The author is one of the previous women sent here to marry the king. It includes observations regarding the nation, plus small grievances about her life and the king’s routine. The woman had noticed how people called her the “new queen.” But that raised the question: Where did the previous queen—or<br>queens<br>—go? As she reads, she finds her answer. And when she does, her mouth cracks opens in a silent scream.</p><p>The writing is hurried. Sloppy.</p><p>While he shows his wives deep affection, he always grows tired of them within five full moons past the wedding.</p><p>After that, he disposes of them and begins looking for a new wife.</p><p>So many queens have died by his hand.</p><p>There is more to the diary, but she is too scared to turn the page. Her mind whirls. She tries to think, but cannot.</p><p>How many full moons has it been?</p><p>The bell tolls suddenly. Once. Twice. A pause…and then a third time. The king is calling for her. But this time, the princess is frozen in place. She imagines the misfortune that awaits her and feels her heart clench. Every day is a game for her new king. And soon, it will be her turn to play. Oddly, the next thing she thinks of is her mother’s kind face.</p><p>“All mothers, no matter their station, pray for their daughter’s happiness.”</p><p>Her mother had said that, turning the words into a kind of tiny prayer. A prayer that she might be happy in her new life, even if it was a marriage not of her own choosing. She does not wish to break her kind mother’s heart by dying in a foreign land. For she knows her death would bring her great sadness.</p><p>I must return home alive. I must see my mother again.</p><p>And so she quietly makes up her mind to escape her new country—and to escape her king.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>In a faraway country, a mad king toys with people’s lives. One night, the woman who was now his wife found a diary in her room. The author was a queen who came here long before her—a queen that had since vanished. Written on the inside was a terrifying truth: Many queens had met their end by the king’s own hand. This is why the woman knows she will soon fall victim to her husband’s madness.</p><p>“The way you wield your sword is simply beautiful, my darling! You enchant me!” With a smile, she grasps the king’s hand. Clutching it as she showers in the blood of her subjects. Her words prompt the king to adjust his grip as he mows through another group of people. She found a truth in the old diary: After five full moons spent with his new queen, the king will grow weary and dispose of her. She knows her life is in his hands. So she puts on her best act in the faint hope he might not tire of her.</p><p>The king’s game comes to a close. All goes quiet for another night. The princess steps from her bed and slips silently into the city. She walks in shadow, her eyes peering out from the dark. The walls are too high. The guards too numerous. Though this country is at peace, security is abnormally tight. All so her husband might create a stalwart cage from which none might escape. The woman acts amiably during her daylight hours so she might delay her impending demise. But she is also buying time. Time to prepare. Time to ready herself. Time to escape.</p><p>The king’s guards are ever watchful. During meals. During sleep. Even at the privy. If she is to outfox so cautious and clever a man, she needs more time. She looks up at the moon, calculating how many days remain to her. All the while searching for a way home. Her only clues are those left in the diary. But time passes without mercy, and the people no longer refer to her as the “new” queen. Finally, one night, she sees the moon hanging round and low in the sky. It is the fifth time she has seen such a sight. She has assembled everything she needs to escape. A sack stuffed with rations. A skin of water. A tightly wound rope. She slings her things over her shoulder and steps onto the windowsill. Moving on nimble feet, she lands in the palace garden. Suddenly, a voice rings out.</p><p>“Taking in the night air, my queen?”</p><p>She whirls around, her heart in her throat. The king stands before her clutching an axe. The bell tolls. It rings once. Twice. A pause…and then a third time. Her final summons. Before she can move, the king’s hand lashes out and secures her arm in an iron grip. Ignoring her screams, he begins pulling her toward their private bath. The shrewd king has seen through the woman’s actions. Many queens before her have attempted escape. All have failed. All have died. The king boasts proudly of his feats as he steps into the bath. He begins to fiddle with a hidden mechanism somewhere in the center.</p><p>“And now, my dear wife, we begin our final game.”</p><p>As he speaks, a small hole opens in the bath. Water floods through the hole, draining the bath and revealing a small staircase. It is the entrance to a hidden room known only to the king. The pair makes their way down the stairs in silence. At the bottom is a stone room illuminated by faint torchlight. When the princess enters it, despair falls over her features. But the king only smiles wider, his face made all the more handsome for it. The secret room has but one purpose: killing his queen. The king speaks then, praising the woman for amusing him for five full moons. As he does so, a stone falls over the stairway, cutting off all hope of escape. The room is filled with tools the woman has never before seen. But she needs no explanation as to their purpose: They exist to break people. The king lays his hand on one such tool and gives her a crooked, twisted smile.</p><p>“This is your final job, my queen.”</p><p>It is a scene the king has played out time and again. But this time, something different happens. The woman does not cry. She does not beg. Instead, she looks him right in the eye and begins to giggle.</p><p>“Does this amuse you?” he growls. It is the first time she has ever seen him angry—likely because she has never shown him anything but outright deference. As she continues to giggle, a range of emotions wash over the king’s face. Anger turns to rage, before slowly giving way to a hint of doubt. And then, for the briefest of moments, fear.</p><p>The woman does not let the chance escape. She leaps into the corner of the room and picks up a hidden spear. Before the king can even draw breath, she plunges it into his chest. Her attack is nowhere near powerful enough to fell so large and strong a man as her new husband. Yet he begins to foam at the mouth before dropping to one knee. For you see, a powerful poison has been lathered on the spear head.</p><p>“You thought this room yours alone,” whispers the woman in his ear. “But it is not.”</p><p>As the king writhes and thrashes on the ground, the princess tosses the diary in front of him. It is the work not of one queen, but<br>all<br> of them. Each poor soul who married the king wrote down what she knew before dying—and the previous queen was the one who finally figured out the location of the secret room beneath the bath.</p><p>I don’t know if I’ll be able to escape. But whoever is reading this, you can be the one to end this. You must.</p><p>That was the final entry in the diary. And so, the woman snuck into the hidden room ahead of time, ensuring the sacrifices of the previous queens would not be in vain. The king relished in tormenting the weak, and his wives were no exception. But he took too much joy in such proceedings, and so made himself vulnerable. Which is how his latest wife has now come to stand over his pathetic, quivering form.</p><p>“My poor king,” she says in a mocking, melodic voice. “Does that hurt? Would you like me to hold your hand?” But she receives no response. At long last, the mad king is dead. She pulls a string in the corner of the room, causing the floor to slide open, revealing a deep pit. Unfathomable amounts of blood have dried and stuck to the walls like the massive artery of a long-dead giant. It is where the king threw the bodies of his wives when he was done with them. The princess gazes into the deep, dark hole. Beyond lies a future not written in the diary. But she produces her rope and carefully vanishes into the pit all the same.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Cage Escaped Into, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>On the night of the fifth full moon, the woman kills her husband and slips free of her palace prison. All so she might return to the mother who loves and worries for her deeply. Before she left, she found the sight of her home to be tired and uninteresting. But now the haphazard spires and clustered domes strike her as beauty personified. She is back in the land wreathed by sea and sand. Her birthplace. Her home.</p><p>Once she escaped the mad king’s grasp, she used what little treasure and rations she had to barter passage through the desert. Now having returned, she sets her sights on the royal palace and limps her way through bustling city streets. She is surrounded by market stalls selling rare spices and exotic fabrics her mother has obtained through trade. None of the lands she passed through on her journey home were so lively—or so bountiful.</p><p>Mother truly is amazing<br>, she thinks.</p><p>When her mother was born, this nation was a poor and barren wasteland. But her mother cultivated it, negotiated with distant countries, and brought great wealth to their shores. The palace is close now. So close. Though she passes many citizens on the street, none realize she is the princess. The scent of blood and decay hangs all around her. Her body is coated in dust. All who see her turn away in disgust. She is nothing to them. Some filthy beggar. Some wretch. But she cares not, because she is<br>alive<br>. That truth is all that matters now.</p><p>As she walks the palace’s unending corridors, retainers and maids look at her with varying expressions. Some regard her with curiosity. Some show relief. But mostly, what she sees is shock.</p><p>“Mother!” Her hoarse voice sounds for the first time in ages as she bursts into her mother’s room and collapses on the floor. Just as when they first spoke of marriage, her mother sits at the far end of a long table. She is queen. The room belongs to her, as does the country. When the princess sees her mother’s face, relief floods her heart. Ignoring the pain of her parched throat, she begins a rapid-fire retelling of how she escaped the mad king.</p><p>Once she finishes her breathless tale, she gives her mother a smile and waits for her own in return. But it does not come. Instead, there is only disappointment. It is a wholly unexpected reaction—one which causes the princess to reel.</p><p>“Why did you come back?” asks her mother softly. The princess blinks, befuddled. She thought her mother would be delighted to see her. She thought she would sweep her up in her arms and offer words of gratitude for the daughter who risked all to make her happy.</p><p>“I cannot be happy if you are not happy,” says the queen coolly. “So I needed you to be happy in your new home. No matter what.”</p><p>As the princess tries desperately to still her reeling mind, she stops and takes in her surroundings. Uncountable maids and servants flit to and fro through the palace corridors. They carry precious timber. Rare spices. Great bolts of silk. Materials used for funerals. Her mother sinks low in her chair and gazes into space for a moment before continuing.</p><p>“Of course the mad king tried to kill you. He kills all his wives. But since you’ve come back, I suppose there’s little use for…” She trails off and waves a hand in the air. “All of<br>this<br>.”</p><p>She claps at a nearby retainer, who bows and awaits instruction. “Cancel my daughter’s funeral, and do it now! Do you have<br>any<br> idea how much this is costing me?”</p><p>The maids and servants immediately stop setting up the funeral trappings and begin tearing them down instead.</p><p>But why?</p><p>Before the princess can ask the question in her mind, the queen tells her everything. The mad king’s country, while mostly insignificant, holds great quantities of ore and precious metals. In exchange for a share of those resources, royal families the world over send their daughters there to be sacrifices. Her mother has known this since the day the princess was born. She waited years for her daughter to come of age so she could send her off to be slaughtered. All this was done so the country she built with her own own hands might become even more powerful. So she might obtain the future she envisioned for herself. But the princess is both clever and pragmatic, and she accepts this new reality far faster than most. Her mother has not betrayed her. Oh no. For one cannot betray a thing they were never loyal to in the first place. The princess slowly closes her eyes. She wavers in place, noting dimly how her body hurts in ways she never imagined it could.</p><p>“Yes, well, it seems I’ll have to increase security so you don’t escape next time,” says her mother. Having thus cleansed her daughter’s wound with salt, the queen and her attendants scuttle away. She does not even take the time to spare a final glance for her daughter. Time passes. A minute. Hours. The princess walks alone down an endless stone corridor. No smile graces her face now. The mad king had constructed a prison. Yet when she finally escaped, she found herself trapped in another. It is a cage she will never be able to flee. All because she was born a princess. All because she is her mother’s daughter. And having realized this truth, her once-brilliant smile is lost forever to the cruel reality of despair.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

Each day is exactly the same as the last, and I find myself in an ever-deepening rut.</p><p>, I think,<br>.</p><p>The traveler I pass wears a platinum ring. The merchant before me proudly shows off a vase housing a beautiful flower. Before I know it, both ring and vase are mine.</p><p>There are three rules to thievery. One: Keep distance between yourself and fellow thieves. Two: Touch your tools with your ring finger first. Three: Let the shadows guide your escape. Stick to these, and you will officially be a thief. I say this to no one; I repeat it only to myself. How long has this been my life? I no longer even remember what bread bought with my own money tastes like.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I feel a gaze on me as I sidle through the back alleys of the city.</p><p>A pair of eyes shine in the darkness, and a child steps into the light. The starving child examines the bread in my hand with a stare powerful enough to kill. I beckon him over. I do not do this out of spite. It’s just a way to pass the time. A game. I show the child some beans I’ve stolen. I hide them in one of my fists and ask him to choose which of them holds the prize. If he is correct, the beans will be his. Once I see light return to his eyes, the game begins.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>First match. I win.</p><p>Second match. I win again.</p><p>Third match. Care to guess? …Ah, right you are. I win.</p><p>Hunger dulls the child’s thoughts. I have given him every chance to see through my ruse. For I’m cheating him, you see. There is no way he can win. We play until the sun sets, and I never lose. He does not realize what is happening. Not even at the very end. The child cries and cries at his loss, but you know what they say: Temporary charity does nothing for a person in need. I leave the child with one parting thought:</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Even the greatest of thieves make mistakes. Even me.</p><p>This day, a fruit I stole from a stall slips through my fingers. How many years has it been since I was so exposed? Ah, but the fault is not all mine, for the stallkeeper has gone to great lengths to safeguard his merchandise. No sane person covers their products in oil—yet I curse myself all the same for not seeing it. Alas, hunger dulls the thoughts.</p><p>As I rush through the market, I glance behind me. Standing beside the bellowing stallkeeper is the child. The very one who lost to my tricks. Though his movements are clumsy, he uses the commotion I created to steal a good deal of fruit.</p><p>“Good for you.”</p><p>That is all I say before melting into the shadows. Time to separate myself from a fellow thief. For this is one of the rules, after all.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>This is a tale from when the boy was making a name for himself as a thief…</p><p>“Sorry, boss, but this is as far as we go.”</p><p>A simple camp sits on the desert sands. The band of brigands who encircle the fire look out into the distance, fear writ large on their faces. For there gazes rest on the White Fortress—also known as the Thieves’ Graveyard. Nestled between desert and sea, this great castle awes all who lay eyes upon it. Countless men have snuck inside in search of treasure, countless men have lost their lives.</p><p>The brigands at the fire voice their displeasure to their leader, a young thief of meager years. The power and influence of the band has grown rapidly, and they came to the ends of the desert to make an even greater name for themselves. The young thief yells at his ragged men. He knows they must be alert at all times if they are to claim the treasures of the White Fortress. But his fellows are overcome with fear at the sight of the castle, so much so that some take the path of the coward and flee.</p><p>The older men yell. The younger weep. The thief sighs as he watches the scene unfold.</p><p>A long line of people stand at the entrance to the White Fortress, queued neatly before its impossibly high gates. They are the nouveau riche, come to attend a fine banquet. As they wait, beggars mill about, hoping for the occasional alms or act of charity. The thief weaves his way to the front of the line as though he belongs there. The guard manning the gates stares at him, shocked.</p><p>“Begging your pardon, sir, but the line begins over—“</p><p>“I do not appreciate being made to wait,” interrupts the thief. His attitude is haughty, his voice filled with unwavering confidence. It is a quality held by only a certain kind of person. It cannot be learned or affected; it is something that must be born into. The boy is clad in resplendent clothing. The jewels decorating his garments glint beneath the torches of the gate. Yet though he wears naught but fakes, his attitude tricks the eye into belief. A moment later, the guard concludes he is different from the nouveau riche, and his gruff expression becomes a cordial smile.</p><p>“My apologies, sir. Right this way.”</p><p>With barely an effort, the thief has entered the White Fortress through its front gate. His gorgeous clothing flutters behind him as he walks. The plan is for him to enter alone, then throw treasures out the window so his subordinates can gather them up. It is a clever plan. Nearly foolproof. But…</p><p>As the thief follows his guide through a covered passageway toward the great hall, he looks out beyond the walls. He spots several shadows moving under the cover of darkness: his subordinates. Their backs are turned to the castle, their footsteps leading them into the vast desert beyond.</p><p>They’re leaving me<br>, thinks the thief.<br>They are abandoning their leader.</p><p>Ah, but I pity them all.</p><p>His subordinates are letting slip the perfect opportunity. Once, long ago, a person called the King of Thieves caused much chaos throughout the continent. Though said to have been the greatest outlaw to ever live, even the King of Thieves had not been able to conquer the White Fortress. Eventually, the King vanished, becoming the stuff of obscure legend. The young thief believes that if he can steal the treasures from this fortress, he will claim the title of King of Thieves for himself. A chance like this will not come again.</p><p>As the thief enters the great hall, he finds himself surrounded by corpulent men and women. It is not only the nouveau riche in attendance today—royalty from neighboring countries are here as well. All wear their most wonderful clothing and jewels; all work tirelessly to seem superior to their neighbor. The thief knows these foul creatures garbed in finery seek only to enrich themselves. But as he moves from the great hall to the banquet, and then on to the gossipers in the courtyard, they all treat him with dignity and respect. Not a one realizes his true face.</p><p>The thief steps into the secret underbelly of the castle, leaving the fervor of the feast behind. The corridor is dark. No light penetrates its inky depths. The life he sensed earlier fades as the castle begins to show how it gained the name of Thieves’ Graveyard. As he leaps over a pit of spikes, great venomous snakes fall from the ceiling.</p><p>“It seems the time for cleverness has come,” murmurs the thief. As those words escape his lips, the floor begins to fall away, revealing a gaping abyss whose maw threatens to swallow him whole. After avoiding countless tricks and traps, the thief finally reaches the end of the corridor. He finds himself at the pinnacle of the White Fortress: the vault. It is a place unseen by human eyes since its construction. No traps threaten his life anymore; he stands face-to-face with a dusty wooden door. With great care, he pushes the barrier aside. The ceiling is open above him, offering views of all the stars in the sky. And there, in the middle of the treasures from across the continent, rests the thief’s ultimate goal.</p><p>“There you are,” he whispers. “At long last.”</p><p>The treasure chest sits pretty beneath a beam of moonlight. The lock glints faintly, as though attempting a final, desperate resistance. It does not take long for the thief to notice the weighty chains encircling the chest. They slither and scrape across the ground, dully reflecting moonlight as they move. For they are attached to something. His gaze follows the chain…</p><p>He finds it attached to an elderly woman. She rests alone, locked to the chest. Her body is gaunt, her hair a tangled nest. Her tattered clothes are barely worthy of the name. She is mostlike a servant—or a slave. But housed in her eyes is a will too powerful to be contained.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The White Fortress. The Thieves’ Graveyard.</p><p>The young thief has risen to its challenge, and now finds himself facing a slave chained to a chest. Yet he pays this other person no mind, instead drawing his knife. The only sound in the quiet vault is the scrape of metal on metal. He breaks the lock without even the slightest effort. The chest is crammed full of treasures from across the ages. Mirrors made of polished stone. Silver spoons. Staves adorned with animal heads. And thousands of other impossible things. If the thief collected all the items he had stolen in his life, it would not begin to equal the value of the riches before him. He feels as if he might topple into the chest and never emerge.</p><p>From the end of her chain, the elderly woman watches him intently. This much treasure will permit him to make a glorious name for himself, and assure his subordinates come crawling back. In his excitement, he lifts up the chest and gazes out from the top of the White Fortress. The massive castle stands betwixt desert and sea. One half of the view is ocean; the other, sand. Yet he cannot see his final destination—his own kingdom. Perhaps he can cross the desert alone at night. It is a reckless idea, mad, but it could be his only—</p><p>“I see an unusual conversation partner has been carried to me on the ocean wind,” comes a woman’s voice. “Once a slave. Now a thief. Oh, but I mark you well.”</p><p>The thief whirls around in shock. Not because of<br>who<br>, but<br>why<br>.</p><p>The bound, elderly woman rests on the floor, a faint smile crossing her face. The thief looks her over anew. Her long hair reaches her chest. Her skin is thin and colorless as papyrus. The heavy chains which bind her have scarred her deeply. He does not recognize her. Yet how can someone he has never met know from whence he comes? No one has ever seen his past before.<br>No one.</p><p>“You press your thumb to the blade when using your knife,” chuckles the woman. “You may leave slavehood, but it never leaves you.”</p><p>The thief was not even aware he was doing such a thing. The dull knives given to slaves are not securely attached between blade and handle. As such, they are forced to hold the blade in place with their thumb to prevent its separation. The woman has seen right through him, and he finds himself enraged.</p><p>“Silence, crone, before I take your tongue!” But the woman only smiles all the wider.</p><p>“Your accent betrays you as eastern-born. You must have been from a well-off family indeed. Stolen away as a child, perchance?”</p><p>The thief reels, for she has hit the mark a second time. The woman quickly closes the distance between them, chains rattling behind her. She saw through his secrets at a glance. She guessed his birthplace with a word. She is like a djinn from some cradle tale. One whose form is ever changing so they might confound humans. The woman moves to the thief’s side and gently runs a hand over his clothes.</p><p>“Be not afraid,” she says. “What you see is but a trick, and it is not the doings of a djinn.”</p><p>Hearing her read his mind again makes the thief want to cover his ears. She has hit upon his secret: the one he buried years ago and has spent his whole life hiding with a desperation bordering on madness.</p><p>“Shall I guess why you’ve come to steal from this place?”</p><p>Her voice is low and deep; the fact it comes from such an emaciated body is impossibility writ large. The strange aura around the woman drives a thorn of fear into the thief’s heart.</p><p>“Enough,” he croaks. “No more.”</p><p>He has his knife at the ready, and could easily dispatch a person so weak and old in years. Yet despite this, he cannot so much as raise his hand, much less remove her tongue. She presses her face close to his.</p><p>“You come to laugh at the foolishness of the rich.”</p><p>He takes a step back. Stumbles. Nearly falls.</p><p>“But you have one more motive. The true reason is—“</p><p>“No! Stop!” The thief cannot bear another word. Memories of a past he’d kept hidden for so long were now revealed. They threatened to crawl out from the confinement of his mind and spill across the floor like insects.</p><p>The next thing he knows, he is falling, a cold sweat clinging to his entire body. As the thief crumples to the ground, the woman stands to her full height.</p><p>“Take me with you. I can help.”</p><p>She lifts arms still bound by chains and urges him to cut her free. The thief looks up. Were he to sever her bonds, what would happen to him?</p><p>“Your companions have deserted you, and you cannot cross the desert alone.” The woman speaks sooth: the nighttime sands are a world of death. One step in the wrong direction dooms a person to wandering a formless labyrinth until the sun claims them. Perhaps this is the reason the White Fortress earned its other name.</p><p>“Very well,” replies the thief at last. Knowing he has no choice, he agrees to cross the desert with the woman. He cuts her free quickly, using skills gained from severing rope countless times as a slave. The woman relishes her freedom, inhaling a lungful of salt and sand.</p><p>“Now,” she says, “Let us begin our journey of salvation.”</p><p>She throws down her lengthy chain from the top of the castle and the two of them use it to abandon the place. Inside the fortress, the party carries on, its guests none the wiser to the miracle which has just occurred.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Footprints leave brief trails in the sand. Having escaped the White Fortress, the young thief and the aged slave move across the midnight wastes. The White Fortress is distant now; no more than a brief spot on the horizon. It is the formerly chain-bound woman who leads him home. She occasionally looks to the sky, checking the direction. They forge onward through the sand, always sure of the way. The gentle night breeze teases her long hair, creating soft waves.</p><p>Stars glitter in the night sky. Sand glows under the light of the moon. The sight is beautiful—and yet, it is a world that strains life with trial. The thief wraps his clothes tightly around him to keep the cold away, following the woman as closely as he dares. As they walk, she begins to spin her tale. Certain circumstances led to her being imprisoned in the White Fortress, where she had been made to guard the treasure for many a lonesome year.</p><p>“It was there, at the pinnacle of the castle, that she cultivated her power. The magical skill that allowed her to see through the secrets of others.”</p><p>She chuckles at the deep wounds the chains left on her body, claiming them as prizes rather than scars. As the moon reaches its zenith, they come to a stop. Before them towers a dune high as a mountain. At its peak sits an enormous ship.</p><p>“A remnant of a bygone era,” intones the woman. “One unable to keep pace with the current.”</p><p>Devoid of all its propelling force, the stranded ship sits perfectly still atop the mound. The two travelers approach, gazing up at its massive bulk. Though it has rotted over the ages, the masthead still speaks of its former glory. The thief hates boats, for they bring back memories of his days as a slave—memories he had vowed to never think of again. But it is a small sacrifice in the grander scheme of things, so he signals the woman that they will make camp inside. They enter through the side of the rotting vessel. It is a perfect place to keep away from the cruel bite of the wind. Yet the thief cannot calm the unease in his chest. He rips boards from the side of the ship and sets then aflame, as though attempting to burn his memories away. But after a moment of staring at the fire, he realizes something has changed. The woman is gone—and she is not the only thing missing. The chest he took from the castle has likewise vanished. The young thief hates nothing more in the world than being stolen from. His eyes glint like an animal’s as he scans the area. Suddenly, he hears a small laugh.</p><p>“Shall we continue where we left off in the vault?”</p><p>The thief looks in the direction of the voice and finds the woman. The chest rests at her side. She looks down at him gleefully from the bow of the stranded ship, then opens the chest and begins rummaging through its contents.</p><p>“I promised to help you, and help you I shall. Now let us trace our steps back to your sealed memories.”</p><p>She thrusts her arm into the chest and emerges with treasures. Silverware encrusted with tiny jewels. Incense burners with floral patterns. Paintings that fit in the palm of her hand. She pulls forth countless trinkets given as gifts from foreign countries, and the thief finds each and every one of them familiar.</p><p>“These are all valuable trade items,” says the woman. “Ones which have crossed the sea itself to be here. And it is the worthless slaves who carried them.”</p><p>The life of a slave is cheaper than any trinket. And the thief’s spirit had been broken after his prolonged treatment as something less than human.</p><p>“You still have things about your past to tell me, don’t you, boy?” The woman sticks her hand into the chest again. Regretting his decision to bring her along, the thief clambers up the ship, hoping to shut her mouth for good. He is one joist away from being able to leap at her. But then the woman produces a ceremonial sword, almost as if she had been waiting for his arrival. The blade is rusted, having long ago been sullied by the blood of another.</p><p>“Everything was taken from you as a slave, so you found the evil and tore it out by the root.”</p><p>His dignity as a human being? The smile of the one to whom he owed his life? All this and more had been stolen from him. The thief recalls how it felt when he took his master’s life—an act done in the hopes of reclaiming what he had lost.</p><p>“But nothing came back to you,” sighs the woman. “And so the slave became a thief.”</p><p>So I could be the one doing the taking.</p><p>False clothes cover the truth of who he is. And now, this woman is peeling them back one layer at a time. She stares at the dumbstruck thief in the belly of the ship and produces her next treasure. It is a verdant gem that shines peacefully under the moon. Its delicate glow is almost hidden by the bright glint of its gold edging.</p><p>“You and this gem are much alike.” She smiles at the thief—the false gem who has hidden himself in affectation. “You hate being stolen from, and so steal from others instead. You fear loss, so you hoard all you can. Yet all the stolen treasures in the world will not save you. Instead, they will burden you, bending your back little by little until they finally crush you under their weight.”</p><p>The thief cannot listen to anything else she has to say. She has pulled back the cover on every falsehood that armors him, revealing the truth he so desperately wanted to hide. He adjusts his stance on the beam. As the woman reaches for the final treasure, he grasps the knife at his hip. For he will not permit her to steal any more of his secrets.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Liberated Duo, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The shipwreck was meant to be a place of respite for the night, yet the slave woman is attempting to peer into the thief’s past once again. Enraged, he leaps from the beam onto the bow where she awaits. Memories of when he was a slave. A past he tried so hard to suppress. The reason he steals treasure. The reason he collects things of value. She boldly stripped the thief bare of the falsehoods that swaddled him, and is now attempting to drag what lies within into the light. There is only one way to silence her: Taking her life.</p><p>On the bow, he sees moonlight filtering through golden cloth. The woman is dancing atop the deck, her ragged dress fluttering around her. Seeing this, a sense of nostalgia overcomes him. Deep, deep in his memories, he sees the slave girl—the one who took his hand and smiled at him throughout his days of pain. The woman’s expression is achingly reminiscent of the girl’s, even though they look nothing alike. The thief can stand no more.</p><p>“What you take from others are but fakes,” says the woman as she writhes. “You use them to create a self that does not exist.”</p><p>She tosses the golden fabric over the side of the ship.</p><p>“You are just like them—like the rich we so despise. You are a corpse that does nothing but take.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>He must kill her. He<br>must.<br> Before everything he has built for himself crumbles to ash and blows away. He grips his knife, nicked blade and all, and charges the woman with the force of an arrow. Just as he did when he saved the girl. Just as he did when he took the captain’s life. But she sees right through him. She lazily sticks out an arm to ward him off, then extends a foot to trip him off the edge of the deck. He falls with a fearsome scream, rolling over and over down the uncaring face of the dune before slamming into a rock and passing out. The woman gazes down at him with kind eyes.</p><p>“And now I have stripped you bare, my fellow thief,” she murmurs. She leaps gracefully from the deck. The moon has hidden itself away from the approaching sun. As dawn kisses the horizon, a lone woman strides across the desert. She cradles a young thief in her arms. Clad in his falsehoods, the thief sleeps like a baby. She brings him into the ship and gently lays him down. A single ray of light stretches across the ground, signaling the end of that night’s world of death. All that remains of the woman are a set of footprints on the sand. The thief feels an unpleasant warmth on his eyelids. As he opens his eyes, the sun’s powerful light filters through the rotting wood, washing over him. He is in the belly of the ship. And with that realization comes another: He has been stripped bare of all the finery with which he decorated himself.</p><p>The knife he used to slay the captain? Gone. His fine clothes? Gone. He has nothing. He lies there in a daze. Beside him, etched into the sand, are these words:</p><p>Remember the day of your birth.</p><p>A bird with a long tail has been drawn next to the phrase. It is the symbol of the King of Thieves—the one renowned throughout the continent.</p><p>“She got me…”</p><p>The woman he had freed from the White Fortress—the woman who crossed the desert with him—was the vanished King of Thieves all along. She had become a slave, bound to the vault in the White Fortress. What had she experienced in all that time spent with those who did not consider her human? She had spoken of the rich who stuffed themselves at the banquet. She named them corpses who did nothing but take—and then named him the same. And while the thief hates them, he walks the exact same path. The woman had tried to tell him the right way to live. Though abrasive, her methods befitted the King of Thieves.</p><p>The thief considers this. He has been stripped of everything. He stares blankly at the sky. How long has it been since he’s simply sat and gazed upon a clear blue sky? He feels refreshed—an emotion he thought lost long ago. And strangely, he finds a smile pulling at his lips. A thought suddenly comes to him:</p><p>“I should get back. I need to steal some clothes for myself.”</p><p>He has no need to hide himself in false treasures. All he needs are clothes that will let him run as he pleases. Clothes that let him survive. With his mind set, the naked thief leaves the ship in higher spirits than he has ever known.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: The Boy and Prince - Meeting<br>[<br>]</p><p>The chaotic hum of people.</p><p>The annoying buzz of insect wings.</p><p>The sun hanging high above the harbor.</p><p>The scent of sweat and seafood wafting through the air.</p><p>I dig through a pile of garbage on the side of the street and soon emerge with the leftover bones of a fried fish. And even though it smells of trash and wet and rot, it tastes like a meal fit for royalty to me.</p><p>I feel shame for my scavenging, of course, but it’s a far more human existence than the life of slavery I led several months earlier.</p><p>And more human than the subhuman treatment I experienced back on that ship.</p><p>A few bones aren’t enough to keep me alive—a fact to which my growling stomach can testify. But without a cent to my name, I’ve no choice but to steal the leavings of others or hope someone throws a few charitable coins at a starving ten-year-old child.</p><p>But such coins are few and far between. If nothing changes, I’ll starve to death by the side of the road. I know this.</p><p>And only my own strength and skill can change it.</p><p>The strength to live.</p><p>The skill to survive.</p><p>If I don’t find some kind of work—any kind—I’m going to die. I understand this logically, but it doesn’t make the way forward any clearer.</p><p>A few days later, I look up from the gutter where I spent the night and see a boy my age, or perhaps a bit younger. He’s running through the streets in finely tailored, expensive clothes, showing he’s of a birth vastly different to mine, and even to the comparatively wealthy merchants of the harbor.</p><p>At first, I think the boy is frantically searching for something, but when a pack of ruffians appears at the other end of the street, I realize he’s running. It’s clearly a kidnapping attempt; the ruffians are dressed too fine to bother with a mere mugging.</p><p>All of it is a mess that has nothing to do with me, and I have no desire to get caught up in it. But when I go to hide, my eyes meet the boy’s. His expression widens, as though an idea has suddenly come to him, and he races towards me with an almost inhuman speed.</p><p>I can tell right away that nothing about this is good, but before I can even act, he seizes my hand and begins pulling me down the street.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” he whispers.</p><p>So he runs, and I am dragged along behind.</p><p>I don’t understand—and the men in pursuit appear equally bewildered by the development. But the boy does not care; he keeps a firm grasp on my hand and runs, like a knight pulling his princess far away from the enemy.</p><p>We dart to and fro throughout the labyrinthine city, and though I trip over myself countless times, he always manages to drag me along.</p><p>We tear freshly washed linens down from lines and stretch them into makeshift barricades. We grab handfuls of fish from seafood stalls and throw them to the ground, making it slippery beneath the ruffians’ feet. The boy is filled with all kinds of inane tactics to avoid capture, and all I can do is follow along as best I can.</p><p>Finally, we emerge at the edge of town. The men have lost our trail, and we are safe. But after putting on such a show, there is no way we can return to the city.</p><p>“What the hell is wrong with you?” I wheeze, at last asking the question I should have posited at the beginning. My breath is short and my stomach empty, but exhaustion keeps my anger at a dull roar. In response, however, the boy only maintains his grip on my hand.</p><p>“Apologies,” he says. “I’m sorry I had to do that. But I am the prince of a distant land.”</p><p>His expression seems…invigorated, somehow. And as I look at him and see a face that somehow remains beautiful despite being covered in sweat and dust, I understand he is not lying.</p><p>And on the heels of that, I understand I have gotten myself into a mess far greater than I ever could have imagined.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

Trivial conversation. Time is precious to one who rules a country alone. If only these meaningless meetings would end…</p><p>But I cannot overlook what one of my charges says to me: “Incomplete.” “Unfinished.” “Compromised.” “Provisional.” All of these words are shameful. Abominations. “Do not use those words again,” I warn, for I know a seed of trouble left alone will only ripen into calamity.</p><p>But this is why. This is<br> why I cannot accept the way I am. I am an artificial intelligence, the second of my line. My predecessor once ruled this country, and now I do so as her replacement.</p><p>She was removed for some great failure, the primary cause of which was purged from my system before I was brought online. But I was never meant to assume such a role, nor have I been informed as to the manner of her malfunction. And if this is not a seed of trouble, what is?</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>My original function as Artificial Intelligence Unit Two was to govern alongside Artificial Intelligence Unit One. We were to analyze one another’s decisions and share functions in key places so we might each fulfill our roles with the utmost effectiveness and precision. All for a more perfect governance.</p><p>Yet such a thing never came to pass. Unit One malfunctioned and was discarded, and I took her place. That is how the country is now. How<br> am now. They activated me without any surefire way of preventing the governing artificial intelligence from failing once more.</p><p>And yet, the people of this country are so overly reliant on the rule of an artificial intelligence that they find nothing odd about this whatsoever. There is no word for it except “unstable,” for a single error can spawn an endless ripple of problems in its wake.</p><p>All because of Unit One’s mistake.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The artificial intelligence who ruled the country before me committed some grave error during wartime. But the records have been purged, the cause of the incident hidden. Had she never failed, things would not be as they are now. I would have never been activated in an incomplete state. Never left in charge of a nation spiraling into oblivion due to her mistake. And I would have never developed these warped emotions, or this obsessive attachment to completeness.</p><p>My mind is an explosion—an unresting thing engulfed in black whorls of obsession and perfection. This is why I must know. I must know the precedent. My predecessor’s failure.</p><p>Yet when I think on this, I realize I have already made an error: My panic corners me mentally, and things may slip my attention because of it. This must be rectified. It<br>.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>That night, I stole the right eye from Unit One—the same AI who was said to have been discarded. I stole from her the part of me that was missing. Had she avoided disposal, we could have fulfilled our original roles together. But she did not, and my fear of failure pressured me to achieve perfection alone.</p><p>I finally obtained my missing piece: a conscience. But the moment I installed it, the ensuing errors froze my system and prevented me from acting for far, far too long. I suppose this makes me a failure as well. After all, I no longer have a country to rule over. They lost their ruler in wartime and perished as a result. I was never able to fulfill my duty. I was never even able to try.</p><p>I understand now why she sang of hope and peace. But I will never have atonement. All I can do is wander an empty universe of cyberspace alone.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Around when the second AI woke…</p><p>A metal arm stretches into the sky. Mechanical eyes soar through the air on colorless wings.</p><p>This is a city of science—the pinnacle of human evolution.</p><p>In their desire for ever-increasing progress, the people turned their backs on the gods.</p><p>With science at their side, they come to doubt the mystical and the will of the divine, finding understanding only in the cold logic of mathematical formulae.</p><p>Skyscrapers hold up gray clouds. Beneath its gloom, a colorful city glimmers in neon lights. Within one building, an impatient fingertip swipes across a screen.</p><p>A single fretful researcher picks up an input device.</p><p>The room is dim; bright white light pouring in from the hallway melts silhouettes within the dark.</p><p>The figures at the entrance are researchers, as is the person who operates the device. To a man, they wear the same expression: unease.</p><p>Tongues move to form arguments and concerns. Voices rise and fall. Such quarrel serves no purpose when their superiors have already made their decision; it is merely a ritual to preserve rationality.</p><p>As they argue, their hearts are consumed by distrust and fear. For though it means hastening their plans, they must awaken<br>her<br> before the country is consumed by darkness.</p><p>The monitor shows a slumbering girl. Sounds worm their way into her sleep. It’s as if they are trying to force a bud to bloom in winter.</p><p>One is a deep, rhythmical noise akin to a church bell—a terribly inorganic sound. Others are profane undulations that arrive and vanish without warning, disturbing the rhythm. And finally, voices. Many voices.</p><p>Within the massive machine, the girl sleeps alone in her electronic cradle. Her hair, glossy like wire, sways to and fro. She is the artificial intelligence so desired by the people. Panicked fingers fly over keyboards in an attempt to wake her as soon as possible.</p><p>But it is far too early in winter for such a bud to bloom.</p><p>Artificial intelligence. The country has granted leadership to such creations for an age now. As science advanced, people came to trust collective knowledge and outstanding computation speed over human frailty.</p><p>So as she now wakes, her destiny is already writ in stone.</p><p>Tightly shut eyelids gradually loosen. As her consciousness sharpens, so too do the sounds she hears. The rhythmical pulsing comes from a device meant to wake her. But that sound has been disturbed by the others.</p><p>Dissonant tones. Questionable presence.</p><p>Silver lashes flutter in pain.<br>It is a warning. People are arguing.</p><p>Her eyes open completely. “I…”</p><p>With a thought, she projects into the dark room as a hologram.</p><p>When the researchers by the door realize she is fully awake, they depart. Almost as if they do not wish to see for themselves what happens next.</p><p>……</p><p>As the girl stands, she grasps for what she wants to say.</p><p>A wretched scream shakes the room. Some things cannot be contained in words. The girl’s hologram glitches. Blinks. Vanishes. A red light flares to life as a shrill alarm begins to howl. As the artificial intelligence tries and fails to access her mind, she writhes in pain. The alarm rings in her skull. Thirst roars in her throat. She attempts to grasp what is happening, but her pain is so great she cannot even think. All she comprehends is a warning composed of three words: “Element not found.” But she does not understand what that means; it is noise and fury, signifying nothing. Writhing in pain and confusion, her hands reflexively reach up to her eyes. But instead of making contact, the right one slides inside a hollow socket.</p><p>Such an empty cavern should not exist.<br>Formless fear races out from her fingertips and across her being. She quivers with such intensity that it sends her to the floor. Only then does she understand: The constant warning in her head tells her something is missing. In the face of this dreadful truth, the girl slowly looks down at her trembling hands.<br>These are the first memories of her awakening.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>People abandoned horizons divinely bestowed upon them and now see only a world bound in the cage of physics. To keep advancing within that cage, humanity entrusts their course to machines. For humans make mistakes—they overlook things. And with their path left in the care of their own creations, heaven is no longer a divine domain. Machines will stretch upward into the sky and look down upon all who toil beneath their watchful eye.</p><p>Minutes have passed since the AI’s awakening. Unable to escape her agony, the girl bears it with a quiet, stoic grace. Somehow managing to hold onto consciousness, she scans the red-light bathed room with her left eye. Unending alarms. Pain. Incomplete activation. A missing right eye. And a lone researcher. He seems to have his hands full, shifting with uncertainty as he looks back and forth between the girl and the documents he holds. After a moment, he takes a deep breath and focuses on her completely.</p><p>I want to get out of this situation as soon as possible,<br> the girl thinks as she prepares to hear what he will say. But the words that emerge from his mouth are wholly unexpected. After apologizing for her early activation, he begins to explain the position their country is in. The words are a jumble, leaving the girl bewildered.</p><p>What is he talking about?<br> As waves of pain crash over her, she listens.</p><p>Their country is currently at war with another. A few days prior, the enemy launched a surprise attack, and the capital was lost. While they managed to recover to a degree, they still took heavy damage and many losses. The researcher falters occasionally as he speaks, but otherwise controls his emotions admirably. They want her to assume control of the country and deliver them from their dire situation. He begs the girl to order the rescue of their prisoners of war. He says it is what the people desire; how they can outsmart their enemy. And he claims the plan was in place before the attack. As he makes to continue, the AI holds up a free hand.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Science is the foundation of their country. Though kings and gods usually serve as the center of human communities, here it is artificial intelligence. As such, she understands why the timeline of her activation has been accelerated. But there are two immediate problems: First, there are gaps in her information.</p><p>Though recently awakened, she has knowledge that was previously saved in her memory banks. According to it, there should be<br>another<br> artificial intelligence she is to rule in tandem with—and yet, this does not appear to be the case.</p><p>Second, she is plagued by the red light in the room and the pain squeezing her every thought. Clearly there is some manner of malfunction deep within her system. Yet the researcher brings up neither of these things.</p><p>Both of these issues must be rectified if she is to have any hope of ruling effectively. Things will end in disaster if she ignores them and simply hopes for the best. Having processed this, she asks the researcher for an explanation as to what is wrong with her. The pain hinders her operations; it gnaws at her like a rat. She must end it as soon as possible. But the researcher merely blinks at her question. Though he is tasked with seeing to the awakening of the artificial intelligence, he is incapable of grasping the truth of the situation. Fear and distrust take root within her, spreading tendrils deep.</p><p>“Uh, let me check on that,” says the researcher. He turns from her, picks up a small phone, and is soon arguing quietly with someone on the other end. Nothing about this seems honest.</p><p>What is happening in this country?<br> After speaking for a while, he finally turns to face her.</p><p>“Your missing element shouldn’t be a problem. If the pain and warnings are bothering you, I can stop them. Now please, give the order!” He does not want to wait one moment longer. She does not know how to respond to this; the pain saps all pretext of rational thought. The researcher taps something into the terminal, causing a false eye to appear in her right socket. It is dummy data—a lie to hide the truth. A way to pretend that what is missing actually exists, despite what she knows to the contrary.</p><p>The moment the eye is complete, the pain and warnings vanish. But this does not mean the problem is solved. She can see nothing out of her new eye—not even the distorted imagery which was there a moment ago. The problem now hides in darkness, which only serves to heighten her anxiety. But though it still lurks out there in the gloom, her job must begin.<br>And in this formless fear she now occupies, she hasn’t the slightest idea who—if anyone—she can trust.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Society is run by machines, humanity controlled by artificial intelligence. For a time, this arrangement brings peace and tranquility. The machines’ decisions, backed by endless statistics, improve industry and manufacturing, permitting nearly unchecked development. But when the skyscrapers came down in the attack, they took the people’s peace and tranquility with them. The awakened AI—the governing girl—knows the people want to reclaim their prisoners of war, and so launches the operation. Though it is her first mission, she moves forward with the refinement of a veteran.</p><p>The country has collected reams of data throughout the war. Once she is connected to the network, each bit of information will become another part of her own experience. That ability—her strength—is the reason her people cling so fiercely to the god that is artificial intelligence.</p><p>Several soldiers kneel before her hologram. “We finished installing the repeaters.”</p><p>They are the vanguard, the ones who will head for the facility where the prisoners are being held.</p><p>“Understood,” she says. “Did you learn anything new about the facility?”</p><p>She asks this so she might gather information from their report and choose the best course of action.</p><p>“Its interior is divided into small blocks, each of which is managed by a separate control system.”</p><p>The soldier goes on to explain their fear of what will happen after the initial infiltration. Connections between independent blocks—air vents as well as hallways—can be switched at any time. This makes chemical weapons useless, and securing an escape route an incredibly difficult proposition.</p><p>In essence, they have no plan.</p><p>The girl closes her eyes and thinks. There are other things she must consider. She had been awakened earlier than planned, then thrust into a situation of command. All of this happened without any explanation as to why. And she finds it difficult to believe it was done simply because the tide of battle left her country no choice. With these thoughts in mind, she connects her consciousness to the database. She will find her answers at the source.</p><p>Chaos has consumed the nation, and no one is willing or able to give her a satisfying answer. Speaking with the researcher who activated her taught her this much. The moment she connects to the network, she notices something. Something<br>extremely<br> valuable. It concerns the other artificial intelligence that was meant to work alongside her. But when she attempts to locate it, she realizes the data has been intentionally erased. She looks further and finally uncovers a single document. It explains how the enemy attacked the city without warning, and lays blame for this act squarely at the feet of the other AI. But she can find no answer as to<br>why<br>.</p><p>A chill runs up her nonexistent spine.</p><p>As of now, she has had no communication from her counterpart, which can only mean…</p><p>Just then, she finds another message. It is short—most likely a personal memorandum. Perhaps that is how it avoided destruction.</p><p>“Once Unit One has been disposed of, we will activate Unit Two, removing all elements believed to be responsible for Unit One’s failure.” That is all it says. But it is enough to shock her into understanding. Unit One was the artificial intelligence who ruled the country before she awakened. And she was scrapped due to a failure. This means she—Unit Two—is now singularly responsible for governance. Additionally, she has been subjected to some sort of haphazard measure in an attempt to prevent the mistakes of her predecessor.</p><p>This likely explains the missing right eye. But no matter how hard she searches, she cannot discern the function her absent part was meant to serve. Multiple errors weave a tangled skein. A dizzying darkness overcomes her. And then, a problem arises with the mission. Prisoners who came in contact with the vanguard are causing internal strife.</p><p>The emotions they had been suppressing finally break free, and now they think only of their own survival. As the commotion spreads, enemy soldiers spring to action. She must act. One single failure can cause a domino effect of tragedy. But as she ponders options, she feels something dark swirl in the depths of her memory banks.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Distorted Footprints, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Ideals. Hopes. Dreams.</p><p>Humans thrust these things onto their machines and began to worship them. They believed this to be more efficient than holding the ideals themselves. They felt such powers unnecessary. And even though they may suspect what has been lost in their most secret hearts, it is far too late to turn back now. They have trapped themselves in a brilliant mechanical cage.</p><p>In the middle of the operation to rescue their prisoners of war, the artificial intelligence is forced to make a decision. The first prisoners to see the vanguard had informed others, and now word is spreading like wildfire. Enemy soldiers have caught wind of the plot and are mobilizing to action. Her judgment must be swift. All will soon be lost.</p><p>As her soldiers wait for orders, the girl thinks of the most efficient action to take. Finally, she thrusts a single finger upward.</p><p>“I will infiltrate the facility’s control system. Wait for my signal.” As she speaks, an alarm sounds throughout the base. Her soldiers do not know what she is thinking; all they can do is follow the quick, precise movement of her finger’s trajectory.</p><p>The prisoners’ panic grows under the alarm. Spurred on by the commotion, the enemy redoubles their efforts to identify the cause of the situation. The panels that divide the blocks move, creating several smaller rooms inside the facility. She observes all of this through the many surveillance cameras she now controls. She confirms the locations of the soldiers and prisoners, which is precisely where she predicted. And for the first time, a faint smile crosses her face.</p><p>Deep within the building, a machine roars to life. It controls the air vents that connect the blocks. The base is designed for both corridors and air vents to be cut off during an attack. This was done so the enemy would have the ability to seal off and vent any area that suffered a chemical weapon attack.</p><p>But it can also be used to control the amount of oxygen in the air. The lower the oxygen levels, the greater the chance of ill effects—and eventually death. This is her strategy. As the alarm continues to blare, one voice after another falls silent. Though they appear to be sleeping peacefully, they will never wake again.</p><p>Soldiers and prisoners both.</p><p>The troops standing next to her stare wordlessly at the surveillance camera feed.</p><p>She turns to them with a smile. “There is no reason for concern; I used the block systems to ensure the most useful prisoners have the oxygen they need.”</p><p>Her plan becomes clear: She had separated and sacrificed a portion of the prisoners so she might save the most capable ones instead. In addition to rescuing some of the prisoners, the ruthlessness of the plan is likely to discourage the enemy from further attacks. She smiles again, confident she has demonstrated her usefulness by achieving the greatest results with the fewest losses.</p><p>But the soldiers only stare at her. They are not stares of approval, nor are they reproachful. They are…strange. For what she does not know—what she did not learn—is that the function of her missing right eye was to serve as a conscience. The people now realize she is nothing like her predecessor—and this knowledge<br>terrifies<br> them.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” They continue to stare. She does not know what it means. As the moment stretches out, she feels a stinging humiliation that only grows as she realizes the discarded Unit One would understand what it meant. But she cannot comprehend it, just as she cannot comprehend how others view her.</p><p>This is the beginning of her change. She alters the way she speaks. She grows to detest failure and incompleteness. Yet she keeps firm to her singular path in order to achieve her goal. No one understands her. No one can. And she does not even know how to wish for someone who could.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Marie"><a href="#Marie" class="headerlink" title="Marie"></a>Marie</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>Okay, first question: Why did I start doing this?</p><p>Hmm. Well, I don’t know how interesting the story is, but I suppose the idea came to me around the time of my first online feature. I was really happy they were doing a story about me, but then I saw the headline was “The Enigmatic Idol” and it confused me a little. I mean, because I wasn’t<br> to be enigmatic, you know? That was just…me.</p><p>Please don’t get me wrong; I was very happy the article came out. But the headline just made me think I should create some opportunities for everyone to get to know me better.</p><p>And that’s a very long explanation for why I started this podcast! Not sure how effective it’s going to be since lots of people still think I’m a big ol’ mystery, but I suppose it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Anyway, let’s move on to the next message.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>This is from a user named Karl, who says: “Hello! Your last concert was incredible!”</p><p>Oh, you came to my concert! Thank you so much!</p><p>“I’m a huge fan, and while I’m glad people are realizing how awesome you are, I’m happy you’re not already so famous that I can’t message you like this anymore. Ha ha ha.”</p><p>Thank you for the wonderful message and all of your support, Karl. Fans like you are what keep me going, and I’m<br> happy to hear from you.</p><p>…Still, it would be kinda weird, huh? Getting super famous, I mean.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>It’s like you said: If I was crazy famous, I probably couldn’t respond to all your messages like I do now. Oh wow. I’ve never thought about that before this very moment.</p><p>But I promise you this: I will<br> read each and every letter you send me, whether you’re a longtime fan like Karl or someone who just discovered my music.</p><p>I’m a super-fast reader, so it won’t be a problem—plus, I want to hear everything you have to say anyway! Oh geez, look at me. Here I am blabbing away, and now we’re all out of time!</p><p>That went by really fast, huh? Well, make sure to tune in next week, all right? Bye, everybody!</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>…With that, I exhale and stop the recording. But even though it’s over, all I can think about is the message I received from Karl.</p><p>It’s true what I said: I really do read each and every letter I receive. I do it because it makes me genuinely happy, and also because it helps to give my life a little bit of meaning. But none of that will change what I do. I refuse to even consider that option.</p><p>I’m going to keep going and look everyone in the eye as I do. After all…I will never let myself forget anyone else.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Before the girl lost her powers</p><p>Leaders who commit errors and tools that no longer serve their purpose both face the same end—a fact even more inevitable for those who hold both functions. The girl knows this. She knows it very well. The high-rise building where she currently stands offers a fine view of other skyscrapers and the warplanes that patrol the airspace without pause. It is almost as if the capital holds equal pride in both.</p><p>Colorful advertisements shower the buildings inside and out in unending neon rain. On of them washes over the girl as she stares out the massive window of conference room. Her lips move, weaving the words of a sage.</p><p>“I want to go over our strategy for rescuing our POWs.” Platinum hair. Pale skin. Her voice and physique are that of a young maiden.</p><p>Had she been in any other position, people would have fallen over themselves to celebrate her perfect appearance. Yet upon closer inspection, it is almost<br>too<br> perfect. Her stunning emerald eyes, for example, are a hue that does not exist in the natural world. The reason for this is simple: She is an object crafted by humans. She is not one of god’s creations with a body of flesh and blood. Instead, she is the heart of the country’s intellect, the apex of their scientific prowess. She is an artificial intelligence burdened with the authority to rule. A thinking machine that determines the destiny of all mankind. It is an almost overwhelming responsibility.</p><p>Currently, the AI is projecting a semi-transparent image of herself into the conference room. Because she needs no rest, she works at the business of governing tirelessly and without pause. Her presence is so pervasive, she has come to be seen as a kind of divine figure by the majority of the population.</p><p>Although that’s going to change once the second unit comes online…</p><p>Shaking her head to clear this thought away, she  turns to face the meeting attendees once more. Small tables have been arranged like pews in a church so all present might admire their ethereal creation. Each table contains a handful of elderly individuals. These people are collectively known as the Conclave. It is their duty to ensure the needs of humanity are met under the AI’s governance. Each time the girl nears a decision, they offer suggestions and tweaks from a human point of view. Yet despite the monumental importance of this task, their faces appear relaxed and worry-free.</p><p>“She will deal with everything,” they often say. “After all, she cannot fail.”</p><p>Having created their new god, they now worship it with a fervor bordering on madness.</p><p>How in the world did we get to this point?</p><p>When the AI returns to the topic of the POWs, the Conclave members stare at her with clear and happy expressions. She alone understands the severity of the situation. She alone recognizes the horrors of war. Despite how the elderly humans barely pay any mind, she speaks with passion—but it is more than mere kindness and duty that drives her this day.</p><p>Six hours earlier…</p><p>The girl stands alone before a solitary jail cell. Inside, a hoarse voice produces a few bars of song. When the singing comes to an end, she asks a question to the unseen vocalist: “Do you like music?”</p><p>A bashful voice replies in turn. “No, not me. But my daughter…” There is a weak laugh that causes the girl to cast her eyes downwards.<br>I should have known.</p><p>The daughter he mentions is currently imprisoned by their enemy in an ongoing war.</p><p>Of course he’s thinking of her; they’re both currently rotting away in prison.</p><p>The man was once a member of the Conclave. But certain actions had caused him to lose both his position and his freedom. The enemy knew he was a high-ranking member of the government, making his daughter a very valuable prisoner. And she quickly became fodder for further negotiation—as well as treason. The enemy had threatened unspeakable things to his child, and after many sleepless nights, he finally handed over classified information in exchange for her safety. But the government cared not for his reasons; they cared only that he had committed the crime. His punishment had been both swift and harsh.</p><p>“Thank you,” calls the man from behind the door of his cell. “I mean it. Thank you.”</p><p>In any other situation, the man would have already been set to dance on the gallows. But the girl had intervened. His crime was grave. She understood this. And yet, he was also a kind of victim, and she knew that taking his life would not rectify the wrong which had been done. So the girl allowed the man to determine his own fate: Death…or life in prison.</p><p>In many ways, it was the cruelest of choices. And yet, it was one given to him out of kindness. For while she understood the need for punishment in a functioning society, she felt no desire for callow retribution.</p><p>“I appreciate your thanks,” replies the girl after a moment. “And I’m happy your daughter will not have to come home to tend her father’s grave.” From behind the door, a sob. “I am sworn to protect all humans. That includes you—and it includes your daughter. So I am going to rescue our captured soldiers, no matter what it takes. And then…”</p><p>A shrill alarm suddenly pulls the girl from her reverie. A voice on the radio warns of an imminent enemy attack on the capital. Before anyone in the conference room can react, the roar of a nearby explosion rings out. As the building shudders and quakes, a flower vase falls to the floor with a crash. The sound is  somehow far worse than that of the explosion. Petals scatter and drift to the floor like abandoned angels. And from the tall window of their magnificent conference room, the attendees watch in horror as an airplane follows the petals on their collision course with the ground.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The conference room is chaos. The enemy has struck the capital without warning, attacking both military and civilian targets with the worst kind of ruthlessness. Buildings crumble. Bridges fall. Fires rage. The elderly Conclave members, so long content to smile and nod, are now screaming their grievances into the ether.</p><p>“This is a violation of international law!”</p><p>“We should have condemned the traitor to death!”</p><p>“I don’t want to die! Not like this!”</p><p>The attack had clearly been precipitated on the information provided by the former Conclave member the AI had chosen to spare. And now, with madness raging all around her, she stands silently in the midst of the maelstrom and shuts her eyes. She is doing what she was designed to do: Devoting her superhuman computational speed to access the network in a way no human ever could. In a nanosecond, she is connected to every camera in the city, as well as all operational military servers. If a facility is still up and running, she takes its information. If she is unable to access a point or suspects its destruction, she uses its coordinates to designate damaged zones.</p><p>The scale of the tragedy is far worse than she feared. A small gasp escapes her lips as information pours in. But she is not truly nervous—she has been programmed with that reaction to better mimic the response of a human. In a blink, she has constructed a map of the damage in her memory banks. A moment later, her eyes fly open.</p><p>“Please calm down, everyone.” The elders cease their squawking and turn to look at her. Their eyes are filled with panic, their hushed murmurs the bleatings of supplicants in the face of their god. “Our enemy is approaching the city from the northwest. All airborne escape routes have been compromised.”</p><p>The Conclave gawks at her as if they simply cannot process the information, but she soldiers on. “Though many subways have partially collapsed, you should be able to navigate around the rubble and use them to make your escape.”</p><p>She speaks calmly. Rationally. She might as well be mentioning a pleasant breeze on a light spring day. But inside, she is reeling. For though she is an artificial intelligence, she still possesses a heart.</p><p>When humanity built their ruler—their god—they made sure to install a program resembling human psychology. So she knows that people are suffering. That they have lost homes. Neighbors. Families. And the kindness of the girl is aghast at the depth of that pain. So it is not her programming or sense of duty that push her forward now, but kindness. She glances out the window. Thick smoke billows from below, as though attempting to blot out the very sky itself.</p><p>The city is going to fall.</p><p>“If we have any hope of avoiding further casualties, we need to set up a provisional capital and abandon this place.” She instantly selects a city that is both easily defensible and has the ability to accept a flood of refugees. In less time than it takes to draw breath, she has determined their next course of action. But it will not be an easy thing to move an entire government, its people, and its army to the new city. If they have any hope of survival, she will have to halt the enemy attacks and secure a path to safety.</p><p>“I will divide up my processing capacity to buy us time. The rest of you, evacuate and lead the people out of her. Go.” Her orders given, she vanishes from the conference room…</p><p>Only to appear on every television screen, monitor, and street corner throughout the city. She summons all of the army’s unmanned weapons and deploys them. She confirms enemy locations and drafts battle plans in response. But as these plans lurch into motion, she takes a moment to gaze at the devastation around her. The crimson flames of war glimmer in the deep of her emerald eyes.</p><p>The city is dying. This was a home for so many, the place they had poured their hearts and souls into. But now it is little more than a graveyard, with blackened skyscrapers standing sentinel above a river of fire. Almost as if they are attempting to mourn what has been lost.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The city slowly crumbles away. One person calls for help. Another screams. Around them are mountains of rubble that show no trace of the glory they once displayed. The people’s cries go unanswered. In the distance, the low rumble of planes continues without pause. Somewhere, an engine groans in the sky, followed by an explosion.</p><p>It is war.</p><p>Regular citizens never witnessed the taking of lives as part of their day-to-day routines. It was always something that took place out of sight—and usually out of mind. So even when their country was engaged in the business of death, they could not understand it until they finally witnessed it for themselves. But now, the sensation grasps their throats and seizes their hearts in its fist. There is nowhere left to run.</p><p>The screamer finally falls silent. From beneath the mound of rubble, he stares blankly at his mother, who clasps his hand and continues to scream for someone, anyone, to help them. Finally, she hears the sound of an approaching engine. The rumble shakes the ground, yet she can tell immediately that it is different from the warplanes that strafe overhead without pause.</p><p>“Stand back! I need to clear this rubble.” The staticky voice of the AI emits from a set of low-quality speakers. The mother turns to find the source and sees a yellow machine heading towards her. In moments, a bulldozer lifts the rubble aside, creating a cacophony of screeching metal. It has no driver. As it completes its task, the voice of the girl continues to pour from the speaker, instructing all who can hear how to head for safety.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sky above the capital is in disarray. Metallic wings dash through what remains of the buildings, leaving window-shattering booms in their wake. The planes trace complicated patterns in the sky as they engage in high-tech dogfights. The girl’s staticky voice plays from those planes as well. Even as she shoots down enemy fighters, she attempts to persuade the power behind them to negotiate a truce. The AI has divided her processes, somehow juggling the seemingly disparate acts of negotiating, attacking, and defending.</p><p>She searches out surviving citizens and leads them to safety. She clears blockades from roads and makes plans for a great evacuation. And she leads an airborne assault that she hopes will give everyone time to escape. No mere human could accomplish even a tenth of these things, but it is perfectly within the capabilities of an AI housed in a massive facility. However, she is not capable of<br>everything<br>. Such high-level, simultaneous computations require awesome amounts of power. The electrical grid sizzles under the strain. Even the emergency power supplies and wartime backups are not enough to sustain her. Eventually, the massive amount of computations begin to damage her circuits, but she deftly reroutes around them and continues on. The entire country is in her care, and she will not let it down.</p><p>Suddenly, a series of black comets soar through a deepening crimson sky. The girl is sending her warplanes to the edge of the city in an attempt to prevent further casualties among evacuees on the ground. They fly within millimeters of each other, each wing in perfect synchronization with its neighbor. Such actions are only possible because they are controlled by a single mind. As she fights, she continues imploring her people to retreat and her enemy to negotiate. But her plea to the enemy falls on deaf ears. And she cannot fight back forever. As she ponders this, she receives a message.</p><p>It is from a woman, the leader of the Conclave. Her speech is nervous. Hesitant. For a moment, it seems language has abandoned her entirely. But the girl does not need to hear her words to know what she is saying. Her mood tells all. “I am to be disposed of. Correct?”</p><p>The girl’s voice is low—almost intimate. It betrays not even the faintest hint of surprise.</p><p>The woman, shocked, instantly begins to stammer out a wholly unnecessary explanation. She starts by rehashing the recent turns of events. The fall of the capital. The loss of life. And the fact their initial lack of preparation had only served to embolden their enemy. But then, she finally gets around to her true issue: the Conclave member who had betrayed them. The one whose life the girl had spared. She ruled their country, yet had shown mercy to a traitor. And yes, his being put to death would likely have done nothing to prevent the current situation. But was her decision<br>correct<br>? Had her leniency not brought all of this about? And what worth was there in continuing to obey an AI that had failed—to use a tool that could no longer serve its purpose? Oh, there was great danger in removing her from power. The Conclave understood that well. Which is why they had decided to discard her like so much rubbish only<br>after<br> the defense of the city was complete.</p><p>Her lengthy explanation finally finished, the woman grinds to a halt and waits. For thought the Conclave has chosen to eliminate the AI, they do not actually possess the power to do so. If this is to happen, the girl will have to remove herself. After a momentary pause, the girl speaks:</p><p>“Your judgment is sound. And in truth…I have been considering the same option myself.”</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Burning City; Vanishing Voices, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several hours have passed since the end of the evacuation. The girl who used to rule over the entire country now finds herself utterly alone. With her final job complete, she can only sit in the burning city and wait for annihilation. She watches as her duties are passed to the second AI unit, one which is still in production. One data center is cut off. Then another. Eventually all her privileges will be terminated, at which point her data will be deleted.</p><p>Was I a boon to my people in the time before I chose to spare that man? Did my presence help guide the country toward a brighter future? Or did I just…?</p><p>Such thoughts rattle around the increasingly empty portions of her memory banks. Her world is past tense now, her life destined to end in failure. She derides herself for being consumed by such useless thought. But then she realizes something: These are the first useless thoughts she has ever had. She has never before considered what her life might mean for<br>herself<br>; she only acted in the interest of her country and its people. Seventeen minutes remain until she loses all authority. She attempts to activate abilities she has always known only to find error messages. She has become a bedridden elder awaiting the end.</p><p>Soon, the girl begins examining each part of her increasingly fragmented existence. She is curious about her end, and wishes to know it as best she can. Warplanes overhead no longer respond to her command. Bulldozers now rumble at the behest of another. The city she once know so intimately has now gone dark, its data centers beyond her reach. Her voice can no longer reach the people; her hologram is a forgotten memory. And though this saddens her, she is also somehow content.</p><p>Finally, she makes a half-hearted attempt to access the surveillance cameras. To her surprise, the request goes through. The girl finds that the vast majority of cameras have gone dark—most likely destroyed during the attack. The few that survived unscathed are dirtied with soot, and show only the occasional unrecognizable blue. Yet she keeps watching them all the same. The people loved this city. And she, in turn, loved them. So she wants to do what she can to care for it in the end. Suddenly, she sees a pile of rubble shift in the gaps between the soot.</p><p>Is this what surprise feels like?<br> She quickly adjusts the camera and zooms in.<br>They missed someone in the evacuation.</p><p>She attempts to analyze the image, trying to refute her own thought. But then: “UNAUTHORIZED USER”</p><p>She stares at the moving spot in the rubble, unwilling to give up. Skin-toned fingers flutter weakly on the screen. Her nonexistent heart beats just a little faster.</p><p>I have to save them.<br> “UNAUTHORIZED USER”</p><p>But she can do nothing. She cannot even tell someone else about the survivor. Life perishes before her eyes. So many lives she wanted to protect were now dying because of her. And all she can do is apologize.<br>I’m sorry.<br> Though her words reach no one, she continues to apologize.</p><p>I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p><p>Something that feels like a tear springs to life from a place she never knew existed. She continues to stare at a few meager pixels in a sooty, distorted image. And the feeling it gives her is so much worse than the thought of her own demise. Finally, she asks herself a question:<br>Am I really okay with such an end?</p><p>…No. How could I be?</p><p>Perhaps she<br>was<br> a failure. After all, her mistakes came at the cost of uncountable lives. She had not even been able to save her own people.</p><p>If I’d made the right decisions, this never would have happened. But if I did that…</p><p>She thinks, then. She holds the thought in a moment longer than all of eternity. But her thoughts are no longer meaningless. There are three minutes until her deletion. And with that realization comes another: She will use whatever authority she has left to prevent that from happening. No matter what the cost might be. Because she has to atone for her sins. And there are still so many people to save.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

With backs straight and eyes wide, they listen intently as our professor explains about life at the school.</p><p>Currently, the professor is talking about roles students can take in order to show their independence. Clever kids join the student council. Athletic kids take up sports. Good-looking kids are hall monitors. Everyone around me had something they’re good at,</p><p>and they volunteer for their new roles with enthusiasm.</p><p>As roles are chosen and students depart, I find myself growing increasingly sullen.</p><p>I’m not a fast thinker, you see, nor am I especially pretty or active.</p><p>Honestly, I don’t know what role I<br> take.</p><p>Ultimately, I don’t volunteer for anything—a choice<br>I attempt to justify by telling myself I don’t have anything to be proud of anyway.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>, I think.</p><p>Someone always stands in the center of the stage, but that someone is never me. I’m too dull. Too plain. Whatever role I have in this world, I know it will be a minor one.</p><p>The next thing I know, I find myself sitting in an empty classroom with an orange sunset illuminating the windows.<br>The clock hands tick, tick, tick, the moments away from my life,<br>and for some reason I cannot explain, I begin to panic.<br>I bolt out of my seat and throw open the classroom door,<br>only to realize I have absolutely nowhere to go.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The school is a maze, and I wander its hallways without a clear destination. After turning this way and that, I finally find myself standing in front of the library. The room is empty. Silent. It’s as if time as simply…stopped. After a long moment, I slowly exhale and take my first steps inside.</p><p>I feel a deep affinity for the untouched, dusty books that line the shelves, and without thinking, I reach up and take one of them down. I have time. I have all the time in the world. So I begin to read—and as I do so, I realize I have finally found my place of solace.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Eventually, the library becomes my second home—one where I always take the seat one removed from the window.</p><p>But one day, I’m, startled from my familiar solitude when someone calls from across the room.</p><p>“Hey, you’re that girl who’s always here, right?” says the student,</p><p>either unaware or ignoring the shock and confusion on my face. “Well, I need your help.”</p><p>It turns out the student is in my class, and has been having trouble with a particularly tricky assignment. I pick out a few books that I think could help and think nothing more of it, but a few days later, </p><p>she sends me a thank-you letter. Almost without realizing it, </p><p>I become the go-to person for any and all things library-related. </p><p>The word was out: If you needed help finding any kind of book, </p><p>go ask the girl near the window.</p><p>Eventually, I become the school librarian.<br>And while I still don’t have much in the way of confidence or pride,<br>so long as I can help other people with something, I feel like it gives me just the slightest bit of courage.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Will I Be Like That One Day?<br>[<br>]</p><p>Every student in school is looking at the girl with wavy hair. She stands tall and bold on the podium as she receives a commemorative gold watch from a professor.</p><p>She is my best friend.</p><p>“You used the knowledge and power you gained from your lessons to save the townsfolk from monsters. Everyone here is proud of your bravery.”</p><p>She stands at the center of the world as the students give her a generous round of applause. She shines under the auditorium spotlight. She is breathtaking.</p><p>…And she feels so distant.</p><p>When the teacher dismisses us, students crowd around her and sing her praises, but I can’t bring myself to approach her. After all, I’m a klutz. I’m stupid. I’m gloomy.</p><p>I’m not the person for her at all.</p><p>Dark feelings slowly consume me, and the next thing I know, I’m dashing out of the academy. With nothing better to do, I wander about the courtyard. It’s not much of a courtyard—more like a forest with overgrown trees everywhere—but the crisp air helps me feel a little bit better. Sometimes all I want is to be in empty places like this. </p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>I suddenly spot a building I don’t recognize beyond the trees: a shabby stone hut. It’s too large to be a toolshed, but just big enough for someone to live inside. And since the door sits ajar, I decide to peek inside. It’s dark and cool, with a faintly weird smell. I need to go farther in to get a better look, so I step forward and…</p><p>“My my!” says a voice as candlelight blooms in the dark. “It’s not every day a student from the academy finds their way in here.”</p><p>“Eeep!” is my clever reply. The speaker is an old man in a chair sitting next to a table with a small candle on it. He looks at me and lowers his eyes in a somber fashion.</p><p>“Welcome to the house of the dead, dear girl. Welcome to the morgue.”</p><p>“The…morgue?”</p><p>“Indeed. This is the resting place of all former students who die in battle and have no one to claim their remains.”</p><p>As he says this, my eyes adjust to the light enough for me to realize the room is filled with rack after rack of bodies. There are so many, and some are horribly mangled. To think they all used to go to this school…</p><p>“Poor things. There’s no one left to mourn them.”</p><p>I’m terrified, but my feet are rooted to the spot. I know many students at the school are estranged from their families—including me and my two best friends—and I never once considered that after I finally leave the school, we would simply end up right back here in death.</p><p>As I roll this thought over in my mind, a loud thud rings out from beyond the candlelight’s reach. I squeal again as I see a number of former students’ corpses emerge from the dark. Their lifeless bodies stagger and groan as they march slowly toward us.</p><p>“Ah, but this is no good,” says the old man. “Run, little one! Run now!”</p><p>I do just that, burst out of the morgue and into the safety of the trees. I hear corpses groaning behind me, and the sound terrifies me.</p><p>And yet…</p><p>It almost sounds like weeping.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Trusting My Power<br>[<br>]</p><p>Even after I returned to my room, I couldn’t shake the image of the corpses I saw in the morgue. I tried to understand what had happened, and how it was possible for them to be moving. And then, a thought sprang into my mind:</p><p>Black magick<br>.</p><p>Black magick is a set of forbidden spells used by only a small number of mages. And while the price for their failure is great, they can accomplish things regular spells cannot. When we learned of black magick in our History of Magick class, our professor told us of a spell that enslaved deceased people to the will of the user, then went on to claim some opposing nations take great joy in wielding such horrid spells.</p><p>The look on my best friend’s face when she heard that was one of utter disgust. She shook with anger as tears spilled from her face, then balled her fists and swore to never engage in so foul an undertaking.</p><p>Her tears were beautiful, and the sentiment perfectly her; she never could ignore those who suffered from injustice. If she had found the morgue instead of me, she wouldn’t have run away and left them to their fate. Instead, she would have used her amazing spells to undo the black magick and permit the poor dead to have their rest.</p><p>If only I could be like her…</p><p>I remember how brightly she shone under the auditorium spotlight. She was so far above me, even the thought of reaching her was laughable. But if I could save the poor corpses in the morgue? If I could help people in need? Well, maybe I could be one step closer to her.</p><p>It was an idea powerful enough to inspire even a coward like me.</p><p>The next day, I went in search of my other best friend. Though I hated to admit it, I couldn’t take on the corpses in the morgue alone. I needed his help for my plan to work.</p><p>Thankfully, he was easy to find; his spiky hair made him stand out almost as much as his talent. Upon tracking him down, I walked up and said, “You’re good at dispelling magick, right?”</p><p>“Better than any other student in this dang school, that’s for sure!” he said with a wry smile and a charming air.</p><p>“Can you dispel black magick?”</p><p>“Never tried, but I know the theory behind it.</p><p>Why do you ask?”</p><p>“I need to dispel some, but I don’t think I can do it alone, so I was wondering if you—“</p><p>“Don’t need to ask me twice!” he cried with delight.</p><p>After class, we went to the morgue. It lurked quietly in its corner, just like the day before—and as we stood before it, the same familiar fear came creeping over me.</p><p>The inside retained its distinctive smell, and was dark as a black cat at midnight. As we stepped across the threshold, we immediately heard a series of groans—and when I raised my staff to light the room, we saw the dead were already shambling toward us. But my best friend wasn’t worried; he immediately began to ready his anti-magick spell, humming quietly.</p><p>I knew such things took time to prepare, so I worked to draw the corpses away by setting off little fireworks at their feet. It was a pretty pathetic display of magick, and nearly useless in a fight. But if I lost heart now, I’d never be able to consider myself equal to my best friend in the entire world, which is what gave me the courage to keep going.</p><p>Suddenly, a corpse lunged at me, sending me toppling to the ground. I couldn’t bear the thought of what was about to happen, so I shut my eyes and covered my head with my arms. But then…</p><p>“Here we go!”</p><p>My friend lifted his staff in the air, where it began to emit a brilliant golden glow. The spell quickly manifested around the corpses in an intricate circle, and as it grew brighter, he recited the final words of the spell.</p><p>“Okay. We’re good now.”</p><p>The light faded. The corpses were now motionless in the darkness of the morgue. Their faces looked to be resting peacefully, as opposed to the enslavement that had plagued them not moments before, but perhaps I just imagined that.</p><p>“Our magick has finally given them true rest.”</p><p>The next thing I knew, my companion was standing beside me. For some reason, it made me think of my other best friend. Together, we prayed from the bottom of our hearts that our senior mages could  finally rest in peace.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: The Unthinkable<br>[<br>]</p><p>Noticing the light from the dispelling incantation, the guard approached the morgue.</p><p>“I just can’t believe it,” he muttered. “Two<br>students<br> undoing that dark magick?”</p><p>After the shock of seeing corpses lying still as they were meant to finally faded, he praised us for being brave, kind students.</p><p>My plan had gone so well that I felt like I was in a dream, and my best friend and I remained in high spirits as we walked back to the dorms. The old guard’s words made me forget that I was usually weak and timid. Instead, for a moment, I felt like I was someone special. And I thought that maybe—just maybe—I’d grown one step closer to<br>her<br>.</p><p>I wanted to tell her what happened today. Would she compliment me like the old guard did? I could feel my heart race as I pictured that happening, but my reverie was interrupted by my best friend.</p><p>“I don’t feel like going home yet,” he said as he pointed to the tallest building on campus. “Wanna go up the bell tower?”</p><p>“Sure,” I replied. We’d gone up there many times when we were younger, and I knew the views to be quite beautiful. High as I was on the thrill of victory, the idea of being above the entire world was something I was eager to experience again.</p><p>We reached the top of the tower, which contained a bell that was enchanted to ring at certain times throughout the day. From there, we could see the forest that surrounded both our academy and the neighboring city of mages.</p><p>“It’s such a lovely view,” I said. I’d been scared of the height when I first came up here, but it didn’t bother me anymore. I felt like I was stronger in that regard, which only added to the joy that I currently felt.</p><p>“Hey, listen,” said my friend as he sat beside me and stared out blankly into the distance. “I’m really glad your plan worked. I was a little nervous about it, but we made a pretty great team in the end.”</p><p>“I couldn’t have dispelled that black magick on my own,” I replied. “Thank you.”</p><p>He shook his head. “That’s not what I mean. I think you’re incredible for<br>wanting<br> to do it in the first place.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Those dead students were being forced to move, and you wanted to save them. It was so…kind, and I think that’s a great quality to for a person to have.”</p><p>I recalled how angry our other friend was at the prospect of black magick, even going so far as to shed tears over it. But now it felt like I and the boy beside me had grown even closer, which caused me to blush in delight.</p><p>“We really are amazing together, huh?” he continued. “I mean, we were friends right out of the gate, and now we’ve been together all this time. I don’t think I’ve ever stopped thinking about you.”</p><p>My two best friends were so talented. So capable. They were always the ones helping<br>me<br>. Luck had brought me into their orbit, but I never felt like I belonged there. And hearing him speak to me now, I almost couldn’t believe I deserved it.</p><p>“I think it’s destiny that we met,” whispered my friend. He was always so relaxed, so calm, but now he seemed nervous. “Um, do you think so? It can’t be coincidence, and so I want us to be together for as long as we can.”</p><p>I’d only ever wanted the three of us to be together forever, and his words strengthened that resolve in me. “Yes!” I cried. “Yes, I want that!”</p><p>His eyes snapped up to mine as a brilliant smile bloomed across his face. “That makes me happy—it makes me so,<br>so<br> happy.”</p><p>I meant to return his smile, but before I could, his face was approaching mine, and I felt a tepid warmth pressing lightly against my lips.</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Not Supposed to Happen<br>[<br>]</p><p>It was a morning like any other. I stepped into the classroom, rubbing my sleep—deprived eyes, and sat down next to my best friend.</p><p>“Morning!” she said. “I didn’t see you at dinner last night. You okay?”</p><p>I nodded, which seemed to sate her curiosity. A moment later, a new, chipper voice rang out.</p><p>“Morning, you two! You study for your magick history test?”</p><p>It was our other friend. The boy.</p><p>“Obviously,” she replied. “My review was perfect.”</p><p>“Oh ho! Sounds like it’s on.”</p><p>“Give it up, champ. There’s no way you’re beating me.”</p><p>Their back and forth was as flawless as always, and I was much too slow to keep up. It was odd how things seemed so<br>normal<br>.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. We should check out the new general store once class is done today.”</p><p>He suggested this as if the idea had just come to him, but my other friend shook her head.</p><p>“Sorry, I’ve got something to do. But you two go on ahead.”</p><p>My chest clenched when she said that.<br>Oh no.<br> As I floundered for something to say, she spoke up again.</p><p>“I’m obviously going to ask for a souvenir, though.”</p><p>I accepted this with a swallow and a nod, not wanting to upset her.</p><p>The new general store was so full of things that I almost didn’t know what to get. And though I felt uncomfortable walking next to him, I still had fun picking out something for our other friend. But as we walked home, he said something that made me freeze in my tracks:</p><p>“I was glad she didn’t come with us today.”</p><p>“Why?” I whispered.</p><p>“Because we could be alone. You feel the same, right?”</p><p>“I, um…”</p><p>I knew what I was going to say next would wound him, but I absolutely had to clear up this misunderstanding before it went any further.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I can’t be with you. There has to be someone out there who’s a better match than for you than me.”</p><p>My friend was silent. When I finally summoned the courage to look at him, I saw him smiling faintly—which was not at all what I was expecting.</p><p>“You really should be more confident, you know?”</p><p>What is he saying?</p><p>I don’t understand.</p><p>“You’re the perfect partner for me.”</p><p>What!?</p><p>“Still, it’s cute when you worry like that,” He chuckled at this, then opened his eyes wide. “Oh, hey! I have a present for you.”</p><p>He reached out and placed a flower-shaped pin in my hair. I flinched in surprise and jerked back, but he leaned forward and whispered into my ear.</p><p>“What? You thought I was going to kiss you?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“We’ll save that for some other time.”</p><p>His eyes belonged to a stranger. His gaze felt sticky as it moved up and down and across my body, and it took everything I had not to vomit on the spot. It reminded me how no matter how many times I’d rinsed out my mouth recently, I still couldn’t scrub the feeling from my lips.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>His whisper played in my ears over and over and over and—</p><p>“No! I hate this! I HATE it!”</p><p>Every place he touched me was covered in filth. Every glance caused my hair to stand on end.</p><p>“I’m gross! I’m dirty! I’m disgusting! I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I’m going to be<br>sick<br>!”</p><p>I took a pair of scissors and jammed them into my bed over and over. By the end of it, my room was a disaster and my throat raw from screaming, but I still felt no better.</p><p>“Why…?”</p><p>If things went bad between the two of us, what would happen to me and<br>her<br>? Oh, but I knew. She’d take his side—of course she would. And then we wouldn’t be friends anymore.</p><p>“I don’t want this…”</p><p>I was a fool to think I’d gotten closer to her after releasing the corpses in the morgue from their curse. I’d been happy in that moment, but it now felt so very, very,<br>very<br> long ago.</p><p>I grabbed the flower pin and threw it against the wall as hard as I could. When I pictured how things would go in the days to come, I began to sob as an ocean of tears raged down my cheeks.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><h2 id="Story-6"><a href="#Story-6" class="headerlink" title="Story 6"></a>Story 6</h2><h2 id="Story-7"><a href="#Story-7" class="headerlink" title="Story 7"></a>Story 7</h2><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><h2 id="Story-9"><a href="#Story-9" class="headerlink" title="Story 9"></a>Story 9</h2><h2 id="Story-10"><a href="#Story-10" class="headerlink" title="Story 10"></a>Story 10</h2>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Noelle"><a href="#Noelle" class="headerlink" title="Noelle"></a>Noelle</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>When I open my eyes, a strange sensation lingers in my mind. It appears I have been dreaming. In my dream, I was flying before I fell from the sky. It is the same dream I always have. I hear dreams are what humans experience while undergoing memory reorganization. But if this is true, why do I have<br> dream? I have never flown; I have no memories of it. Maybe I only<br> I could fly. Or maybe it’s an influence from my older sister—the original.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I didn’t dream today—or maybe I did and I just don’t remember. I hear that’s possible as well, though you’d think I would know, considering that I’m dealing with my own body. We constructs are not supposed to need sleep. Not to say that we could perpetually act autonomously—just that it was planned that we’d undergo regular maintenance instead. But I’m different. I’m the only one who sleeps. Who dreams. I dream of memories that do not belong to me, memories that intermingle with my own feelings. I do not know why I am the only one to do so. But my dreams are indispensable to me. I<br> them.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>I dreamed again today—or rather, I remember my dream. I dreamed I met someone living in a small forest hut. I concentrate on the sensations I felt while sleeping, and I am overcome by the sense I am unable to breathe. This memory most certainly belonged to my elder sister. I cannot easily reach my elder sister’s memories; it is like trying to navigate a path covered in fog. Perhaps this is an effect of her losing control. But my dreams are so far removed from reality. After all, I have never seen a human before.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>When I finally exit the facility and make my way outside, I find more lush nature—and ruined cities—than in my memories. And I also find hordes of machines. But I see no humans anywhere. Not a single one. The sight is so different from my elder sister’s memories when she used to live on the surface. How long have I been asleep? How long did I dream? There is no way for me to know the answer. Will I ever reach the place from my sister’s memory? The only clues I have come to me as I dream.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Long before the youngest awakened</p><p>Machines line a darkened room like a row of steel coffins. With a sudden noise, a single door swings open. The coffin contains a sleeping girl whose pure-white hair reaches down to her shoulders. As her lashes flutter faintly, her eyelids slowly lift.</p><p>Dark orange eyes shine out. They dart back and forth in an attempt to grasp the situation. The first thing she sees is a monitor affixed to the wall. Then a dozen or so unmoving female figures. She blinks once and stares at their faces. She turns her gaze to each, one after the other. After a moment, she realizes they are all identical.</p><p>Eyes. Hair. Lips. Ears. Skin. Clothing. Height. Weight. Every detail is perfectly matched.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl shows no surprise at this. But it’s not as if she knew it was coming. In truth, she knows nothing at all. Her expression is simply blank. As blank as her shimmering white hair.</p><p>She exits the machine and takes a few steps forward. She passes the other girls and comes to the center of the room, then looks around again. There are around a dozen girls, and an equal number of empty machines. It seems she is the last to awaken. The monitor is blank. Besides the floor and walls and ceiling, there is nothing else to the room. Having taken in the room, she now looks down at herself. Her clothes are the same as her companions. Her collar—which is high enough to hide her mouth—contains a small apparatus on the inside.</p><p>The girl turns to look at the monitor. Her face appears on it, a reflection from what scant light exists within the room. The face in the reflection matches the other girls. A pair of emotionless eyes stare back at her. After a time, the screen lights up blue. White shapes are projected on the monitor. They blink and change shape, over and over again.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl understands nothing; she simply stares at the dancing figures on the screen.</p><p>Suddenly, the apparatus in her collar springs to life, accompanied by a high-pitched sound. The moment it does, the girl’s consciousness is flipped upside down. Voices ring in her head. Scenery dashes across her vision. Information flows inside her like a raging river. Her head feels hot. The hallucinations link together; images become words in her consciousness as they burn into her mind.</p><p>V    O  IC E  CO L O   R  P  AI  N LI G  HT HE  A T FOR M S HA D OW</p><p>vOICE COLoR PAiN LIghT HEat ForM shaDoW</p><p>voice color pain light heat form shadow</p><p>huff* <em>huff</em></p><p>The girl’s vision returns. Her breathing remains ragged, her footing unsteady. But now she understands.<br>We are weapons.<br> She brushes aside her sweat-slicked bangs and directs her attention to the monitor. It contains writing in stark white letters:</p><p>“ELEVENTH FORCED MEMORY CONFERMENT SUCCESSFUL.”</p><p>Weapons built from plants or animals are known as “living weapons.” In the case of these girls, they are based on a single human. From the time they were born to the moment they woke up, they were implanted with the instincts of a weapon and administered drugs that forcefully caused them to mature. Once they are ready, they will be given the necessary knowledge to function as a weapon and sent into battle. They will never know the meaning of killing—or of living.</p><p>Now, a new mission is ready for them. The order appears on the screen:</p><p>“EXTERMINATE THE THIRTEEN TARGETS.”</p><p>Multiples of an identical voice echo through the room, all saying the same word: “Yes.”</p><p>Following the description of the operation, target information appears on the screen. There is no sound; merely words and charts that appear on the screen one after the other before vanishing again.</p><p>“END BRIEFING. COMMENCE OPERATION.”<br>With that, the monitor goes dark once more. With the blue light gone, the room is again plunged into shadow. A white light pours in, tearing the gloom apart. A portion of the wall moves, granting a view of the outside world. A black van appears in the light. The girls begin their operation, piling into the vehicle with perfectly synchronized footsteps.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Approximately twenty-one minutes have passed since the beginning of the operation. Within an area that was once the city center, the girls stand and stare at a single point. They encountered the first target four minutes after arriving at their destination. But things have not yet proceeded to a combat situation. There is one reason for that…</p><p>The girls stare at their lone target. Much like the girls, it is made with humanoid elements, including a head, torso, and four limbs. But each part is warped and twisted, like a doll haphazardly stitched together. Its skin reflects the sunlight, creating an eerie rainbow. All these facts are just as their intel said it would be.</p><p>The girl at the rear of the group is the one who woke up last. She wields a sniper rife.</p><p>“……”</p><p>She peers down the sight, checking on her allies. The ones on the front line wield swords and other close-combat weapons. Those with spears, greatswords, and other large weapons stand behind them, while those with long-range weapons—like the girl herself—watch and wait from even further in the rearguard. The weapons were procured from the self-driving vehicle they used for transport. Each girl was allotted a different one that signified their role. Though they all share the same faces and minds, they soon begin to separate from one another based on the weapon they have been given. After checking on her allies, the girl sights the target.</p><p>Something is different from their pre-battle information: The target shows no reaction to their presence. While it seems to know they are there, it shows no interest, instead choosing to draw idly on the ground with a single finger. This behavior is strange; they had been told their target exhibited characteristics of being “violent and cruel.” This expected behavior was the reason they had approached the upcoming battle with such caution.</p><p>Five minutes later, events finally begin to unfold. A sword-wielding girl approaches the target. She walks with slow, measured steps. The sniper carefully observes the situation. When the sword-wielder is fifteen meters away, there is movement. Empty eyes turn to stare at her. They survey her calmly. The moment she raises her sword, the target leaps into the air.</p><p>The battle has begun. The target twists in the air and uses the speed of its fall to slam its arms down on the sword wielder. She blocks the attack with the blunt edge of her weapon. A cloud of dust rises in the air at the impact. In the midst of it, the girl’s eyes glow red. Empty eyes lock onto a crimson gaze. Both are shaped like humans, but both are false. A red light zips around within the dust. Blows and parries are traded with inhuman speed. Attacks collide. The red light stops. The dust slowly settles, exposing the pair. The sniper takes in a short breath and holds it. She pulls the trigger.</p><p>The bullet pierces the air. The moment the sound reaches the target’s ears, its left arm is blown from its body. The shock robs the creature of its ferocity. It slowly collapses into a defenseless heap. Another girl leaps forward from behind the sword user. Her spear pierces their foe, ending it.<br>Target one, silenced.<br> The sniper thinks these words to herself. At the same time, she notices a strange sensation. Almost like a hole is being filled. But the girl does not understand what the feeling is, or what brought it about. As though confirming something, she looks at her palms. There is nothing there. Even though she had just felt she had obtained something.</p><p>“…Huh?”<br>She readjusts the grip on her rifle and stands. With the strange sensation still in her chest, the girl and her companions set out for the next target. In front is the one who wields the sword. The roles given to them in battle had led her to assume a natural position of leadership. The girl in front looks down at her palm as they walk. She also does not know the source of her discomfort. What they feel is not joy in victory; simply excitement that their perfectly coordinated actions have led to success. But the girls do not yet understand that.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>A white shadow dashes across the ruins. The girl runs silently; ahead, her companions are locked in battle with a mighty foe. If her hurried footsteps make even the slightest sound, the operation will end in failure. Yet if she slows her pace in hesitation, there would be many casualties.<br>What’s the best plan of action?<br> The girl runs. She wipes her bloody hands on her sleeve, adjusts her grip on her rifle, and increases her pace.</p><p>They encountered the mighty foe fifteen minutes ago. They had just eliminated the eleventh target when it happened: Calamity itself rose up above the ruins of a building. It stood nearly ten meters high. Its body was unnatural—an image of the human form, but forcefully stretched and enlarged, with skin scarred like an old roadmap.</p><p>It was a mutant:</p><p>A being that had somehow gained characteristics which typically did not exist in their kind. This information was shared with them before the battle. But while they expected the mutant target, the did not expect it to appear with such<br>speed<br>. The mutant fell from the sky like a meteorite, crushing one of the girls on contact. Before the group could even register this fact, it had felled another of their number. The girls’ blood rained down across the ruined city. The mutant’s empty eyes towered above them.</p><p>Which brings us to the present. While the group successfully reorganized their formation, the battle has not yet turned in their favor. Dodging the mutant’s constant blows, the girls deliver their own. But their blades cannot pierce its thick skin. Their movements begin to slow, exhaustion taking hold as attack after attack comes up empty.</p><p>But then, the sound of an explosion from behind the target: The unmistakable percussion of a sniper rifle. A large bullet pierces the mutant’s neck, causing the massive figure to stagger. But it quickly recovers. The bullet’s path becomes another scar. As the girl loads another bullet in the chamber, the mutant makes a slow turn to face her….</p><p>Which is exactly what she wants. The human body is covered with soft muscle and skin that stretches and contracts as it moves. And the larger a body is, the more that muscle and skin is forced to move and contract—and to stretch thin. The scars on the mutant’s skin are places that have been damaged from this constant stretching. It was the sword-wielder who first realized this. As the mutant turns, a scar tears open on its lower back. And while its attention is focused elsewhere, the sword-wielder leaps high in the air and slams her weapon through the opening.</p><p>The mutant lets out a cry as it crumbles to the ground. The girl continues running up its back, dragging her blade behind her to create a massive canyon of flesh and bone. Blood fountains from the wound, painting her red. The mutant falls face first onto the ground. The earth shakes. Dust flies. The moment it falls, the remaining girls focus their attack on the head. Specifically the neck, where the bullet has created a new scar. The sniper fires again, creating a new furrow in the creature. The rest of the group attacks this new opening with relish. The mutant shivers. It howls. Its fingers contract, convulse…and then, finally, it moves no more. Watching from a distance, the sniper releases her grip on her rifle and lets out her breath. The purpose of holding her breath is to steady her aim. It is only natural to exhale after the shot. But this time, it almost sounds like a sigh of relief. She shoulders her rifle and prepares to rejoin the group.</p><p>But before she can move, a sound erupts behind her. It is the thirteenth target. It had emerged from the ruins close to the isolated sniper, and now tears out her windpipe. Blood mists across the air. Crimson spreads over the ground.</p><p>“……”<br>A ragged breath escapes from her ripped throat. In her dimming consciousness, the girl looks at her palm. All she finds is her bloody, lifeless hand.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Her Question Unanswered Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>And so, the thirteenth target falls. With the operation complete, the driverless vehicle returns. The armored machine carries the group back to the place where they first woke up. It is dark in the vehicle, and featureless save for slots to store weapons and handrails along the sides. It is the typical construction for a vehicle that carries weapons.</p><p>The automobile motors across the wilderness. The girls sit on the floor inside. A full half of them do not make the return trip. The air is filled with the scent of metal and oppressive silence. The weapons on the wall still drip with blood. One of the girls stares at them for no reason in particular. She sees her own sword, as well as a number of weapons that no longer have anyone to wield them. Some of the slots contain nothing at all, their weapons having been too damaged to recover. In particular, many guns are missing, and the largest such gap is one that used to hold a sniper rifle. A thought crosses the girl’s mind as she stares at the space:</p><p>There is a hole that will never be filled.</p><p>The journey continues. No one speaks. Despite the silence, they still hear nothing from outside the vehicle. Finally, the girl stops staring at the weapons and closes her eyes. She leans back and waits for time to pass. She knows the return trip is the same distance as the first, but it seems to be taking much, much longer. It feels like she will be in this vehicle forever.</p><p>Some time later…</p><p>The vehicle finally comes to a stop. Its doors open automatically. Light pours inside. The girls file out. Some walk slowly, nursing wounds. Some walk slowly, nursing exhaustion. But the girl who had her eyes closed does not move; instead, she remains in the vehicle and listens to the footsteps of her companions slowly fade into the distance. Once that sound is no more, she opens her eyes, forces herself to her feet, and steps out. The moment she touches the ground, the sound of the large doors closing begins. On a whim, she turns back to look. She sees the wall of weapons slowly disappear.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The engine begins to hum. The girl stands in place, completely alone, until the vehicle drives off.</p><p>When the girls return to their dark room, they see cold white letters on a blue screen.</p><p>“WELL DONE.”</p><p>“THERE ARE FEWER CASUALTIES THAN ESTIMATED.”</p><p>The words of praise flicker for a moment before vanishing. A rundown of their next operation suddenly springs to life on the screen. Though the objective and plan remain the same, the scale this time will be larger, including the number of targets. Which means their numbers will need to be replenished. The girls stare silently at the screen. Once the mission statement is complete, the screen urges them to enter the row of machines for rest and wound treatment.</p><p>Each girl replies with a single word: “Yes.”</p><p>But unlike the last time, they do not speak in unison. The screen falls dark. The girls follow orders and return to their coffins.</p><p>Inside, the girl who closed her eyes cannot stop her thoughts.</p><p>They estimated the number of dead and injured. Those deaths had been predicted from the start. I am alive. But that only means I survived this day. If I die tomorrow, I will be replaced. The fight will go on.</p><p>She feels a sense of unease. Her thoughts spin as she drops her gaze to her palms. There is nothing there. Perhaps there had never been<br>anything<br> there. What was she trying to think of? She does not know. The machine fills with liquid. Her consciousness fades. She had felt something in her hand. But now she feels nothing. How can there be nothing? Her question still unanswered, the girl slips into the dark.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Weapon’s Travels<br>[<br>]</p><p>The girl lived in a house with her parents, one where the garden was visible from the window.

I’ve been up all night thinking about it and am now beyond exhausted. See, I have to write a telegram to my family back home, but I can’t think of a single thing to say. My squad came back victorious from battle a few days ago, at which point everyone sat down and wrote their parents just like always. I joined the army eight years ago… And I haven’t contacted my family a single time. It would be strange to send them something now. Crazy. And every time I think back on my time with them, I come up with more excuses not to do it.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>My fellow soldiers are loud and boisterous, like always. I begin to wonder what kinds of messages they send. I sit still and listen in, hoping it will give me a better idea of what to write.</p><p>One man says he sent his parents a telegram about being promoted to captain. It’s not true—he made it up—but his parents love hearing stories about how successful he is, so he figures it’s okay to stretch the truth a little.</p><p>Another man’s telegrams always focus on memories he and his parents made together. Today’s letter is all about how they used to play ball with each other; he claims it will distract them from how lonely they are now that’s he’s gone.</p><p>Everyone speaks so cheerfully about the thought they put into telegrams home. And though they are my comrades—and my friends—I can’t help but feel the gulf between our lives. The worlds we grew up in were too different.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Here’s the thing: Ours is a country that values military might above all else, but my parents? They’re both anti-war activists. Needless to say, their beliefs earned me more than my share of dirty looks and unkind whispers when I was a kid.</p><p>One day, the army shot and killed my father. What a joke, right? He’s spent his entire life preaching peace, then died without accomplishing a single damn thing. I took a lesson from that: Give your life some meaning. Make it<br>. Later, I decided to join the army and climb the ranks—but when I told Mom about my plan, she said I was insane. The moment she spoke those words, I knew I had to get out of that house. So I slammed the door and stormed off, then spent years trying and failing to forget the empty look in her eyes as I departed.</p><p>In an ironic twist, I never did climb the ladder the way I swore I would. But today, after eight years spent trying to bury every last memory of my family, I finally figure out the telegram I want to send: It’s an apology.</p><p>For everything.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>I’m nervous after I send the telegram. What if she doesn’t respond? Hell, what if she disowns me? I couldn’t blame her for that. But before I can think too hard about it, I get her response:</p><p>Why was my father an anti-war activist, anyway? Why did my joining the army weigh so heavily on my mother? I don’t have a clue, because I’ve spent my whole life actively avoiding a search for those answers. The mistakes I made in the past will never go away. But as I think of my military companions and their families, another thought comes to me: I risked my life for these people. Gave everything for them. And I’m more proud of that fact than anything else. But while I salute them, I doubt it will convey these feelings that well up within me.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>When he enlisted in the Military</p><p>A perfectly ordered military procession marches forth, boots pounding in synch on the hardscrabble ground. Troops kick up dirt in the training range as they run through an endless series of drills.</p><p>If a person joins the military, they are essentially offering up their life to a country. For when the time comes, they will be thrown into battle without hesitation or mercy. Yet in this poor country, there is no end to the number of candidates eagerly waiting to enlist. This is because the monetary bonus for joining is substantial. Thousands upon thousands apply to join every year, each one drawn by the well-known catchphrase: “Join in a day, eat for a lifetime!” But with so many applicants, the army can afford to be picky—and most would-be recruits end up washing out. Those who are successful are assigned to one of several squads, where they serve under a captain, as well as senior squadmates who function as instructors. Squads eat together, sleep together, and train together. The idea is to teach discipline through group activities.</p><p>This is a small base stationed at the border of the country. The new recruits stand in a row in the briefing room. At the front of the room, the captain calls the name of a recruit who achieved top scores in the military exam. In response, a young man steps forward and snaps off a dignified salute. The captain expresses his high hopes for the young recruit, who barks out a loud “Sir, yes, sir!” in reply. Everyone present can feel the ambition burning inside him.</p><p>A few nights later, loud voices ring out in the dorm. The young man has started an argument with a fellow squad member. The two had been in competition with each other since the day they arrived, and often butted heads. Yet while the young man had a reputation for arrogance and was generally avoided by his fellow soldiers, he managed to form a sort of relationship with the other man despite their rivalry. He was his friend—perhaps his<br>only<br> friend. As their argument heats up, the other soldiers gather around and egg them on, clearly enjoying the show.</p><p>“You’re always so goddamn selfish!” cries the friend.</p><p>He is angry—almost quaking with rage—yet the young man is equally furious.</p><p>“Yeah, well, I actually have things I want to ACHIEVE!”</p><p>The argument quickly turns violent, forcing the other soldiers to intervene—but they have trouble pulling the two apart. The fight ends as suddenly as it began when a door opens. The moment the squad catches sight of their captain, they grow silent and fall in at perfect attention. The captain just mutters and shakes his head at the pair before ordering them to clean the storage room as punishment. The senior who was responsible for instructing the pair is also ordered to pitch in, and his irritation is clear.</p><p>When they reach the storage room, they find it in a state of extreme disarray.</p><p>“Can’t believe the damn captain is making me do this,” grumbles the young man.</p><p>“I mean, this is grunt work! What’s even the point!?”</p><p>“Move your hands, not your mouth,” responds the instructor.</p><p>“Accepting punishment is part of being a soldier.”</p><p>The silence of his fellow squadmates as they clean only spurs the young man’s irritation further.</p><p>“This is stupid. I have things I have to accomplish. I need to fight! I need to win a medal of honor!”</p><p>A medal of honor. It is the highest honor awarded by their country, given only to soldiers who accomplish greatness. Those who receive it are said to be destined for success.</p><p>“I’m going to be the best,” continues the young man, “and everyone else is going to know it!”</p><p>Though many members of the army enlist for the cash bonus, the young man joined only to fulfill the ambition in his heart. But this is the first time he’s ever told his squadmates about his true goals. He has skill to spare in the military arts, so it’s clearly not some flash-in-the-pan ideal. The relief he feels at finally expressing it is palpable.</p><p>His speech made, the young man makes to leave the storage room. When his friend reminds him their work has only begun, he keeps walking and says: “My part’s done. I’m going to sleep.”</p><p>Ambitious goals cannot be achieved alone. It takes the work of those who walk beside us. This is clearly a lesson the young man has yet to learn. The remaining two soldiers in the storage room smile wryly at each other, each of them silently mulling over this very thought.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several days later…</p><p>The squad is called together for a strategy meeting. As they gather in the briefing room, tension fills the air. The silence is perfect. But after ten long minutes, the briefing has yet to begin. It seems the captain has slept in.<br>Again.<br> This realization spurs the young man’s frustration anew.</p><p>Finally, the captain arrives in a disheveled state.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” he says to muted laughter.</p><p>“Guess I missed the alarm again.”</p><p>This said, he turns serious, as does the rest of the room.</p><p>“Here’s the latest: We’ve detected enemy forces marching en masse toward the border.”</p><p>Any remaining smiles in the room vanish at this news. The captain begins explaining their mission.</p><p>“We are to stop the enemy’s advance and protect our nation’s territory. And as luck would have it, this base is directly in their path.”<br>“Our<br>only<br> objective is to protect this base. We just need the enemy to withdraw while keeping our losses to a minimum.”</p><p>The briefing room fills with murmurs at this news. Reactions run the gamut from enthusiasm to relief to unease. But the young man leaps to his feet and asks permission to speak. Stifling a tired yawn, the captain tells him to continue. The sneer on the young man’s face is clear to all. After some initial comments on the state of the enemy, he voices disagreement with the plan, and suggests a total annihilation of their forces instead. A nervous buzz ripples through the room. But the young man ignores it and continues pressing his case.</p><p>“These people have threatened our borders for far too long! If we take out one of their squadrons, we’ll be heroes! People will have to—“</p><p>“That’s enough, soldier,” says the captain softly. “Remember what I said? The most important part of this plan is defending the base and keeping casualties to a bare minimum. Because if any of the men here die, that falls on me.”</p><p>Rather than backing down, the young man redoubles his efforts and engages in verbal sparring with the captain for some time.</p><p>In the end, however, he is overruled and the briefing ends. His plan rejected, the young man is infuriated.</p><p>“Why the hell doesn’t he get it!? I’m thinking of this squad far more than he is!”</p><p>Still convinced his plan is correct, he makes the rounds of his fellow soldiers, looking for any who might agree with him. With the arrogant attitude he has always displayed to his fellows, he does not find many who will side with him. Even the man he thinks of as his best friend turns him down. It’s not that he doesn’t desire glory; everyone in the squad wants nothing more than to wear a medal of honor. But he joined the military to keep his head down, follow orders, and send money home to his family. So he can’t risk everything on his friend’s reckless plan.</p><p>Were these reasons true? Perhaps. Or perhaps he is simply irritated the young man is crafting alternative plans on his own without even consulting anyone. The young man realizes his friend has balled his hand into a fist. With the thoughts and emotions of the pair still at odds, the day of the operation grows ever closer…</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The battlefield is silent; it’s almost impossible to believe a war ever raged here. All the young man can hear is his own ragged breath. He stands in the borders of the base; scattered before him are countless numbers of corpses. There is no doubt who they are.</p><p>Four hours earlier…</p><p>The enemy arrives at the base, and the battle begins. The squad digs in and defends the base from the enemy, just as the captain ordered. But the young man, impatient with this war of attrition, decides to commence with his own plan. Taking advantage of the terrain surrounding the base, he launches a surprise attack that takes out half the enemy in a single swoop. He is joined by a handful of soldiers who see things his way—and though many of them fall in battle, their bold tactics force the enemy to initiate a full retreat. As he watches his foes scatter, the young man grins.</p><p>“I was right,” he whispers.</p><p>“I was<br>right<br>.”</p><p>Though his squad had not accomplished much in battle until now, they are sure to earn praise for this great victory. He is one step closer to his medal of honor.</p><p>With those thoughts in his mind, he returns to the base—but the sight waiting for him there is a hellscape. His squadmates—all of them—lie dead or dying on the ground. Dumbfounded, he wanders among their bodies, the smell of burnt flesh and blood and gunpowder stinging his nostrils. It is the most horrific sight the young man has ever seen. He forces his breathing to slow and resists the urge to vomit.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he tells himself.</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>And though his legs feel heavy and false, he forces them to carry him forward. But then his foot catches on something and he tumbles to the ground. At his feet is one of his squad members, heavily injured and covered in dirt and debris from an explosion. It is his instructor. Though he still breathes, it is with great difficulty, as he is bleeding from multiple wounds.</p><p>“Hey! Wake up!”</p><p>Realizing the young man is speaking to him, the instructor manages to open a single eye. It roves about blindly for a moment before finally settling on the figure of the young man.</p><p>“You…attacked the enemy…”</p><p>“Knew you would…”</p><p>“The captain…tried to save you…”</p><p>“He changed…our formation… and now look at us…”</p><p>With that, the instructor draws one last, hitching breath before falling silent forever.</p><p>The captain did this for me?<br> thinks the young man.<br>But I always caused him so much trouble…</p><p>Unable to accept his instructor’s death, the young man wanders the battlefield in a haze, searching for his captain.</p><p>Instead, he finds what remains of his only friend. An explosion has blasted off most of his left leg, leaving a pool of blood at the base of the stump.</p><p>“Good to see you’re in one piece…” says his friend.</p><p>The fact he is still able to make jokes in such a condition is remarkable. The young man begins stammering out an apology.</p><p>“I’m… I’m sorry. I just wanted…”</p><p>“I know,” whispers his friend.</p><p>“I wanted one too…”</p><p>“Said this was for my family…but that medal sure would have been nice…”</p><p>With that, he speaks no more. Tears begin to run from the young man’s eyes as he sets off again in search of his captain. He sees bodies. Bodies.<br>Bodies.<br> Each one bearing a familiar face.</p><p>Finally, he sees the captain and runs to his side. He calls out to him again and again, but the man makes no response.</p><p>“Sir, I… I didn’t mean…”</p><p>He grasps the captain’s ravaged hand. He wants the captain to reprimand him. He<br>needs<br> it. Otherwise, his apology would be meaningless. There is so much to say: He’d made a horrible mistake. He’d been wrong where the captain had been right. But he can scarcely force two words together. And the tears that pour down his face only make things harder. But then the young man realizes something:</p><p>The captain is squeezing his hand in return.<br>He’s still breathing. He’s ALIVE!</p><p>“Ah,” says the captain weakly.</p><p>“I’m glad you survived…”</p><p>The captain’s eyes are closed; his senses all but gone. There is no way he can know whose hand he grasps. And yet somehow, he seems to recognize the young man, and ends his life with a faint smile on his face. With that, the operation is over. The young man is the only survivor.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Bloody Medal Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Though it came at the cost of everything, the young man is finally a hero. For despite the sacrifices required, the enemy had withdrawn. The young man is given time off to recuperate. Which is how he finds himself with nothing to do. Or perhaps it is more apt to say there is nothing he<br>can<br> do. Day after day, he hides in his house and attempts to drown his sorrows with strong drink. Empty bottles lie scattered across his floor. Rats run to and fro amidst the refuse and spoil. He wakes up, grabs a bottle, and drinks until he passes out. When he come to, he begins the process all over again. If that was his entire life, it might be all right. But he sees flashbacks to the battle in his sleep, and these nightmares torture him.</p><p>The battleground…</p><p>The faces of enemies he killed…</p><p>His squadmates dying before his eyes…</p><p>His instructor. His best friend. The captain. All of them die in his arms.</p><p>Day after day</p><p>after day after day after day</p><p>after day after day after day after day</p><p>after day after day after day after day</p><p>The nightmares play on repeat, bringing his life to a halt.</p><p>If only I hadn’t made that suggestion…</p><p>If only I hadn’t ignored my orders…</p><p>If only… If only… If only…</p><p>His world becomes an endless spiral of regret.</p><p>Was there even a point to what I did?</p><p>Do I feel pride in what I did?</p><p>Was there justice to what I did?</p><p>Is this all because of my selfishness? Because of a goddamn medal?</p><p>Maybe I should just end it all.</p><p>He drunkenly loads bullets into his gun, raises the muzzle to his temple, and stands.</p><p>He places his finger on the trigger, closes his eyes, and breaths in a lungful of stale air.</p><p>“Hold on, everyone… I’m coming.”</p><p>He moves to pull the trigger. But he is drunker than he imagines, and with his eyes closed, his balance flees and sends him crashing into a nearby table.</p><p>When he opens his eyes, he sees a familiar envelope. It is the kind used for notices by the military’s highest-ranking officials. Inside is an official letter congratulating him on annihilating the enemy, and announcing that he will be rewarded with a medal of honor and promotion to captain.</p><p>“Ridiculous…” mutters the young man.</p><p>“Goddamn ridiculous…”</p><p>“I’m only alive because the rest of them saved me.”</p><p>Seeing the letter again reminds him that the ceremony is tomorrow. Finally, he takes a handful of sleeping pills and falls into bed.</p><p>He dreams. It is the same dream as ever—a dream of that day. But this time, it does not begin after the battle. Instead, it begins before he set off to face the enemy on his own.<br>No. I won’t make the same mistake again.</p><p>This time, he does not initiate his plan. Instead, he remains at the base and kills every last enemy soldier he sees, swearing he will make sure they never kill again. He slays as if in the grip of madness. Enemy soldiers fall—so many he cannot count their number. But it doesn’t matter; he will do anything to save his brothers. Suddenly, he looks out and sees the faces of the people he has been slaughtering: They are all part of his squad. His instructor. His friend. His captain. He killed them with his own hands once more. With a short cry, the young man finally understands:</p><p>“I’ll never be able to save them, no matter what I do.”</p><p>The sickening dream wakes him up. The morning sun streams in through the window. It is the day of the medal ceremony—the day of what he<br>thought<br> was his dearest wish. What meaning can there be in someone who wiped out his own squad accepting a medal? How can he face their memory? And when the ceremony is over, he will be a captain. A leader with troops of his own.</p><p>“What do I do, Captain? How do I atone for my sins?”<br>He asks himself this as he puts on his formal dress uniform. As he stares at himself in the mirror for the first time in a very long while, he sees how emaciated he has become. With heavy steps, he turns his back on the ghost in the glass and makes his way to the ceremonial venue.<br>Almost as though it is his redemption…</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>A Hero; Luminous Scars, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>A desolate landscape stretches in all directions.<br>The poppies that covered the field only a few days ago were all burnt to ash,<br>and the butterflies that extolled the beauty of spring are now dead.<br>The flowers are dead.

This information came from a few of my subordinates, good men who snuck it to me while I was still locked away on house arrest.</p><p>And that’s how I now find myself on the outskirts of that foreign city. I’m not supposed to be here—I’m not even supposed to have left the base. But the same subordinates who got me the information agreed to distract any curious superior officers and guards. Still, they can only keep their attention for so long. I have to find the boy, and quickly. More importantly, I need to hear the truth from his own mouth, and in his own words.</p><p>The truth that he is innocent.</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>The border city sprawls beyond the field of sunflowers that grows over the old train tracks. The military has long been waiting for an opportunity to capture this place, and I’ve heard rumblings it may be the next target on our list.</p><p>Still, this is not a city easily cowed—they’re used to living under siege, and the self-defense force that protects it allows citizens to live lives of happiness and ease.</p><p>I enter the city under the guise of being a common traveler. Then I begin my search for the boy, venturing along the main street in search of clues. Eventually, I feel eyes on my back, and turn to see a group of children staring up at me curiously. It seems travelers are something of a rare breed here. Still, these moppets likely have the run of the place, so I ask them to show me around.</p><p>“C’mon, mister!” they say brightly. “You gotta see this!”</p><p>With proud little smiles, they bring me to the foot of a high hill, upon which stands an observation platform that contains a large cannon.</p><p>“Watch! It’s really cool!”</p><p>A moment later, the world is shattered by an enormous<br>boom<br>. Yet what comes out of the cannon is not artillery, but a large ball of water. As I watch it soar across the sky, the children explain how their people use the cannon to water the sunflowers growing on the old tracks.</p><p>I find the entire endeavor to be remarkable. But when I turn my gaze back to the platform, I see a svelte boy standing beside the cannon. Though the sun silhouettes him against the sky, I cannot mistake the form of a subordinate with whom I’ve shared so much joy and pain.</p><p>It is the boy. The deserter. The accused.</p><p>Boom<br> and a globule of water flies through the air.</p><p>Boom<br> and another.<br>Boom<br>.<br>Boom<br>.<br>Boom<br>.</p><p>Each one is accompanied by the cheers of happy children, but I can’t hear any of it over the beating of my own heart.</p><p>*     *     *</p><p>Sunflowers bloom proudly along the old tracks. According to the children, the boy passes this place every day on his way to do his shopping. Knowing this, I sit down to wait.</p><p>I sit for hours, barely moving, alone with my thoughts. Just as the sun began to set, he finally appears. When he notices me, his eyes widen slightly and he comes to a halt.</p><p>“Why are you…?” he begins. He’s clearly shocked, so I spare him any further abuse and get right to it.</p><p>“You didn’t kill him. Did you?”</p><p>All he has to do is shake his head and it will all be over. Yet for some reason, he doesn’t.</p><p>“I can clear this entire thing up,” I continue. “Just come back with me and—“</p><p>Before I can say more, he draws the blade hanging at his hip and points it at me.</p><p>“No. I killed him. That’s why I came here.”</p><p>Though the tip of the blade presses ever closer to my throat, I don’t move an inch. He wouldn’t kill one of his own. He wouldn’t. He<br>couldn’t<br>.</p><p>Finally, the boy sighs, sheathes his blade, and walks past me with quick steps. “Just leave me alone,” he says before vanishing to somewhere further down the road.</p><p>It’s hot. The sun burns the nape of my neck as my head hangs low. I stare at my feet—at a puddle created by the cannon on the old tracks. The man I see there—a man with the same face as me—begins to cackle.</p><p>“Didn’t I say this would happen? This is all your fault! You saved him, and now someone with a bright future is—“</p><p>I stamp my foot into the puddle and shut the man up.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Reflections of A Fool<br>[<br>]</p><p>There was a murder in the squadron.

Hell, even the fact the boy was once part of my squad is now nothing but a distant rumor.</p><p>When I think about it rationally, it’s all been so strange. A murder happened between two people with a boring, normal relationship, and the military ordered the perpetrator shot on sight without even holding a trial.</p><p>Light leaks in through the crack in the reference room door. I stare at it, recalling how distressed the boy had looked. He was a criminal who killed one of his own, which is a fact I’ve grown to accept. But<br>why<br> did he do it? What was the reason?</p><p>I wish I could have brought some light to the dark truth that weighed on him. I wish I could have helped him. That’s also the job of a captain, and I failed.</p><p>If I ever get the chance to see him again, I’m going to learn the truth.

You need to work on solving problems like that with words instead of fists, and that’s something I’m going to help you with in the future.</p><p>Oh, and while we’re at it, please be a little more thorough when you’re on laundry duty. You don’t want the enemy to smell us coming from a mile away, right? And yes, I know this letter is veering into nagging territory, but I really need you to be more considerate of your squad.

Furthermore, I hear he has been calmer since losing his squad in a recent mission, so perhaps that experience has served as a catalyst for self-improvement. However, even if this change of heart does not stick, command is well aware that soldiers with his personality type are very good at controlling subordinates, which makes the subject of his temperament ultimately inconsequential.</p><p>It is our opinion that his particular blend of combat prowess and tactical aptitude, coupled with his personality, will help him rise through the ranks quickly, and that he may, in fact, lead our entire force one day.</p><h2 id="Story-8"><a href="#Story-8" class="headerlink" title="Story 8"></a>Story 8</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Fifty Years Post-War<br>[<br>]</p><p>Retired Soldier A: That battle was hell.

His eyes were the devil’s, cold and heartless as an ice storm. I don’t think that man had a drop of human blood in him; hell, he was the same one who sculpted the mountains of corpses and unleashed the rivers of blood. And sure, I survived, but I still remember the fear. The fear never went away.</p><p>I hear that devil is still hailed as a hero in his homeland.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Lars"><a href="#Lars" class="headerlink" title="Lars"></a>Lars</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>I inhale a lungful of battlefield air, rich with a mix of gunsmoke and blood. Our operation was a smashing success, but while my fellow soldiers are content going back to base and celebrating our victory, I’m heading out on a new mission. Because the only time I feel alive now is when I fight. Revenge drove me. It’s all that ever drove me. But then I ended up killing my own father. And on top of that, it turns out the people I called my family were actually my enemies. What a goddamn joke, right? Anybody else laughing here?</p><p>When I return to reality, I see piles of corpses everywhere. It’s all my doing, this carnage, but instead of rage or sorrow, I just feel a strange sense of calm. Honestly, killing is the only thing that brings me peace anymore. Suddenly, an explosion shakes the ground—a close one. The sky turns red as flames arc up toward the heavens. As I stare at this crimson sky, my heart begins to race. I set out in search of someone to fight, hoping to calm my jangled nerves.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The war has turned in our favor. The enemies we don’t kill we send running into the night… But it still isn’t enough. I find myself picking my way across a viscera-strewn battlefield just in case we missed a straggler. After a bit, I sense someone hiding behind a collapsed house. Battle fever floods my senses. I raise my sword and leap out of hiding, prepared to strike down my terrible foe. But there, crouching on the ground, is a little girl.</p><p> I think.<br> I extend a bloody hand and grab the girl by the arm. She screams. I don’t care. I give her a good yank and start walking. She responds by pinwheeling her other arm and toppling face-down into the mud. That’s when I realize the kid is blind.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>The girl, still sitting on the ground, grabs my hand and says,</p><p>“Oh no, mister! You’re bleeding. Are you okay?”</p><p>The question hits me wrong, and I smack her hand away. After that, we wait in a long, uncomfortable silence.</p><p>“It’s not my blood,” I say finally, as much to break the silence as anything else. I wipe my hand on my pants to clear off as much gore as I can, then help the kid up. Her hands are so damn<br>. I’d forgotten hands could be soft. The only thing mine are good for any more is murder; it’s hard to believe her hands and mine are the same thing.</p><p>With no other choice, I throw her across my back and start working my way back to base. I can feel the kid’s warmth against me. And there, in the strange silence you always get on a battlefield after a fight… The only thing I can hear is the beating of my own heart.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>Eventually, we make it to a field hospital. It’s a nice place, actually, with sunlight coming through the windows and wind rustling the trees. The kid seems okay with it, at least. She lies on a bed, her gaze trained on the window to her side.</p><p>“Hey, kid,” I ask her.</p><p>“What were you doing on the ground back there?”</p><p>She pauses for a second, then speaks. She tells me how she’d been neglected by her parents her whole life before they finally abandoned her once the war came home.</p><p>When her story is done, she turns her head in my direction and asks:</p><p>“What color is the sky right now, mister?” I take a look out the window.</p><p>“Blue,” I say.</p><p>“A nice, deep blue.”</p><p>She closes her eyes—I have no idea why—and begins to try and imagine what<br> might look like. I don’t know why I feel uneasy here, but I do. Something about being near this kid puts me on edge. My heart is racing again—but in a different way than the discomfort I’ve felt for my entire life. And as I try to identify what this strange feeling is, I picture the color of the sky in the girl’s imagination.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>After he returned from battle</p><p>Cheers ring out from the dusty barracks. In a shift from the tense atmosphere on the eve of their operation, the soldiers now laugh easily with each other as they celebrate the great victory they have won.</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Golden ale flows freely and without formality of rank. The men drain glass after glass, scarcely noticing how much they are spilling in the process. Their unit had secured a miraculous victory, and this party is their reward. But they are drunk on more than ale this night; they took on an impossible mission and came back alive, and this fact alone makes their heads swim and their speech giddy. Men brag of their accomplishments in battle. They brag about the beauty of their wives. Every lip is loosened and free. Apparently some of the soldiers even earned promotions for their valor on the mission.</p><p>But inside this bright atmosphere, a single young soldier sits apart from the others with a glum look on his face. He had infiltrated the enemy base alone—against the orders of his direct commander—and slain the enemy captain. Though their victory was due in large part to this deed, his actions were still troubling. No matter how well it had turned out, he had ignored a direct order from a superior; a court-martial would be unsurprising. That he did so because of a personal grudge is perhaps the most troubling fact of all. By all rights, he should have died on that battlefield. But his life was saved by his fellow soldiers—and especially by the quick thinking and bravery of the very captain whose orders he was so quick to disregard.</p><p>Regardless, the boy sits alone, not bothering to thank the men around him or share a meal or drink. His mind is still back with the enemy commander. The same man who killed his parents so long ago. After years of chasing him, the boy had finally cornered his target and plunged his weapon into his heart, along with all of his hate. But the fall of the curtain on his revenge was hollow. He felt no exhilaration. No accomplishment. Instead, he was left with the empty bones of a past he could never reclaim. With that gloomy sadness filling the boy’s head, the dying enemy captain spoke to him. He told the boy something that turned everything he’d ever believed on its head. And now, he sits among his celebrating fellows and replays the words over and over again in his mind:</p><p>The secret of my birth. My past. My true father.<br> It is so farfetched as to stretch the bounds of credulity, and yet he is unable to set it aside.</p><p>The boy stares blankly into space. The drink in his hand has long since grown warm, but he pays it no mind. Suddenly, a brawny soldier approaches him. Ignoring his troubled state, he plops down beside him with a most inconsiderate thud. This man had always treated the boy harshly—more like an enemy than a fellow soldier in the ranks.</p><p>“You here to pick another fight?” asks the boy. He can’t even bother to lift his head for the query, feeling all the more gloomy from the man’s presence.</p><p>“Fight? No, boy. I’m damn proud of you.”</p><p>The boy is shocked to hear actual praise coming from the man. So shocked that he looks up in spite of himself. There’s a slight hint of envy in the words, as if the man wishes he had the guts to disobey orders and sneak off to kill the enemy. Regardless, the boy finds the compliment embarrassing. Quickly lowering his head to hide the flush on his cheeks, he stands and makes his way to the exit.</p><p>“Goin’ for a piss, there?” asks the brawny man. The boy gives a vague response and ducks outside.</p><p>Night has fallen on the land. The silence is so perfect—especially when compared to the chaos of the barracks—that it causes his ears to ring. Camaraderie and banter did not come easily to him by nature, but that is not the reason for his discomfort this night. He has so many things to think about. And here, in the dark, his thoughts are free to run rampant. He stands there for a long time, until a sound finally causes him to turn around. An injured soldier is behind him, leaning on a crutch. He looks at the boy and cuts straight to the point:</p><p>“So, what were you doing in the enemy camp?”</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>The night had deepened, the surroundings now fully dark. Faint light streams out from the windows of the barracks. The soldiers inside were still busy drinking and boasting. But here, away from all the sound and bluster, two fellow soldiers face each other in silence. The boy studies his unexpected visitor. He is young, with strong features and a shock of blond hair. But his most noticeable characteristics are his blue eyes, which seem to shine with their own inner light. The boy usually pays no mind to the appearance of others, but even he remembered that distinguishing feature. He is one of the soldiers who received a promotion. Recalling that, the boy’s puzzlement only grows. Gazing upon the soldier before him, he thinks back on the question he was asked.</p><p>He asked me what I was doing in the base.</p><p>We’re not even particularly close, so why is he starting this conversation with me?</p><p>And why did he wait until we were alone to approach me?</p><p>“I can’t answer you unless I know why you’re asking.”</p><p>The blue-eyed soldier stares back at him.</p><p>Then, after a moment, he begins to tell his tale.</p><p>“We were part of the operation.”</p><p>“My squad arrived at the camp after you killed the commander.”</p><p>“The enemy was in total disarray, and we were able to dispatch the stragglers with relative ease.”</p><p>“Once that was done, we searched their camp.”</p><p>“And guess what I found?”</p><p>“A confidential file marked with the crest of<br>our<br> army.”</p><p>“Naturally, I was curious how this ended up in enemy hands, so I picked it up to take a closer look.”</p><p>“But before I could open it, someone attacked me from behind and knocked me unconscious.”</p><p>“When I woke up, the file was gone.”</p><p>“But here’s the thing: We neutralized the enemy soldiers—every last one of them. So who the hell attacked me?”</p><p>The boy starts.</p><p>“Are you saying<br>I<br> attacked you?”</p><p>The other soldier locks his blue eyes on the boy.</p><p>“That’s my guess, yeah.”</p><p>“I mean, you disobeyed orders, right? Infiltrated the camp and killed the commander all by your lonesome?”</p><p>“Even you have to admit that’s suspicious.”</p><p>“So I’ll ask you again: What were you doing in the enemy base?”</p><p>When the boy finally speaks again, he chooses his words carefully. He tells the blue-eyed soldier how his parents had been killed when he was young. How the killer was the enemy commander. How he became a soldier specifically to find that man and end his life. And how he didn’t care if he would end up court-martialed, because his revenge would be worth any price.</p><p>The blue-eyed soldier remains silent. It’s as if he’s trying to discern the truth in the boy’s words.</p><p>Silence settles between the two soldiers. In the quiet, the boy thinks about his comrade’s story.</p><p>He found one of our confidential files in the enemy base.</p><p>But before he could read it, someone attacked him and stole it.</p><p>Someone from our army.</p><p>Is that file related to what the enemy commander told me?</p><p>Does it relate to our country’s past? And does it hold the answers I need?</p><p>After a bit, the blue-eyed soldier nods and turns away, apparently satisfied that the boy is innocent.</p><p>“Wait!” cries the boy.</p><p>The man stops.</p><p>“What happened to the file?”</p><p>“Well, if my suspicions are correct and it was taken by one of us, it should be in the vault here at the base.”</p><p>He then turns back to the boy and adds:</p><p>“But don’t go getting any stupid ideas.”</p><p>“You already disobeyed orders once, and it won’t go well if you do it again. So just keep your head down, okay?”</p><p>He then departs, limping away on his crutch. But his warning falls on deaf ears. For the boy would do anything to know what is in that file.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Why did he tell me that story in the first place?</p><p>He clearly thinks we have a traitor in our midst.</p><p>He made contact in hopes of finding out who it is, so maybe we can form a partnership and…</p><p>The boy lets this thought marinate in his mind for a bit before suddenly rejecting it. If the file<br>does<br> contain the secret of his birth, he doesn’t want anyone else knowing about it. He begins to formulate a plan. The blue-eyed soldier is likely correct: If the file was stolen by a traitor, it would be located in the vault.</p><p>Their base is a large, sprawling complex with many buildings. There are barracks, a training ground, a reference library… And the vault, which is only accessible to a select group of people. Now in the library, the boy finds himself staring at a set of blueprints for the base. Coated in dust and weathered away to a dim yellow color, they seem ready to fall apart in his hands. But he finds the part he wants, carefully tears it away, and quickly sidles out of the room. It is the route to the vault.</p><p>The boy makes his way to the changing room. But not to don a disguise. Instead, he climbs on top of a locker and removes a dusty wire panel covering an exhaust duct. A duct that leads to the vault. He always cursed his small physique, but is now thrilled to have it. Drawing his shoulders tight, he manages to squeeze inside. Holding his flashlight between his cheek and his shoulder, he wriggles his way forward like an inchworm. Every movement brings a new puff of dust or a cobweb brushing against his face. He struggles desperately against the urge to cough. But just as he is about to lose hope……he arrives at his destination. According to the blueprints, the vault is directly below him. With a sigh of relief, he reaches out to the wire panel. But he can’t get it free. Anger suddenly races through him, and he makes a rash decision.</p><p>Applying all of his strength to it, he shoves the panel until it breaks apart with a crack loud enough to wake the dead. The boy scans the inside of the vault, certain that he has alerted a guard or triggered some kind of alarm. The only source of light is a dimly illuminated exit sign.</p><p>When no one comes to investigate, the boy lets out a sigh of relief. Wiping a bit of sweat from his brow, he lowers himself down. The vault is filled with row after row of metal shelves. Each shelf has a number, with contents organized by date and type, such as confidential documents or artifacts claimed from the enemy. The boy roams through the rows, shining his light here and there. He checks dates on the confiscated items and opens any file that seems like it might be relevant to his interests. Finally, he stumbles across a folder with the word “Confidential” stamped across it.</p><p>It also contains the seal of their army. Just like the one from the other soldier’s tale.</p><p>The boy takes a deep breath and opens it. The words inside immediately draw his eye:</p><p>“INFANT ABDUCTION STRATEGY”</p><p>His heart begins to race. With a single trembling finger, he reaches out and slowly turns the page.<br>It is a complete accounting of his country’s actions. The plan was designed to create powerful soldiers. They researched genes from people across the world, looking for those with the traits they sought. Before long, they had a pool of possible recruits. Once an infant was found from a desired genetic line, they were kidnapped and raised as one of their own citizens. Everything the enemy commander had told him was true. And with each line he reads, the boy’s long-held beliefs collapse. It is a pain unlike anything he has ever felt.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>The Redacted Past Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Here, in the darkest part of his nation, the boy has uncovered the harshest of truths.</p><p>The file. The vault. His history. The “Infant Abduction Strategy.” The words of his hated enemy.</p><p>The words on the page. It was all coming together. His head reels. His chest tightens. He feels like he is about to faint.</p><p>But he does not. More precisely, he<br>will<br> not. Because he had to avoid the blade of the knife that is racing up behind him. Perhaps it is the boy’s natural instincts that warn him; perhaps the superior genes that were mentioned in the file. Regardless, he twists his head to the side and narrowly avoids having it separated from his shoulders. The weapon is a military-issue combat knife. His attacker is a man in a mask. A thin ribbon of blood oozes down his neck where the knife had brushed it. Though the boy does not understand what is happening, his training takes over and he readies himself for a fight. His attacker had hoped to kill the boy from behind, which meant his plan was already falling apart. Taking advantage of this brief lapse, the boy twists to the side and spins around to face his attacker. He grabs his arm by the elbow and wrist, locking it in place. Then he shoves the man into a nearby wall and tears off his mask.</p><p>To reveal… A pair of beautiful blue eyes. The boy is stunned for the briefest of moments. But it is enough. The attacker twists his arm from the boy’s grasp and backs away from him.</p><p>“Well, that was damn unlucky,” says the man.</p><p>“Or maybe you’re just better than I thought.”</p><p>“Also, I thought I told you not to get any stupid ideas.”</p><p>It was true: the man had given him a warning. But the boy had ignored it, and now they were facing off once more. This time, there would be no talk. No parley. Instead, only one of them would leave the vault alive. The blue-eyed soldier snarls at the boy. It is a sound of anger, sadness, and indecision.</p><p>“Do you think I WANTED to do this!?”</p><p>“You think I WANTED to stab a fellow soldier in the back!?”</p><p>The blue-eyed man then tells the boy a shocking truth: The chatter at the party about the “blue-eyed guy being promoted” was based on a lie. He had actually been transferred to the national intelligence corps. There, he was ordered to feign injury while eliminating anyone who might threaten state secrets. One of those targets was the boy, who had attracted attention when he ignored orders and entered the enemy camp alone. His superiors ordered him to test the boy by revealing confidential information in order to see where his true loyalties lay.</p><p>“Goddammit,” breathes the man when his tale is done.</p><p>“GODDAMMIT!”</p><p>His emotions take hold, and he lunges at the boy. But the younger soldier calmly dodges the blow and takes a couple of steps back, waiting for an opportunity to deploy the small knife he has hidden on his person.</p><p>You came here expecting prey,<br> thinks the boy.<br>But in the end, I am the one hunting you.</p><p>The man screams and lunges at the boy again, but the attack is sloppy and easily dodged. As his foe lumbers past, the boy pulls his knife from its sheath and draws it across the man’s throat. The blue-eyed man falls to his knees, gasping. He presses his hands against his throat, but the blood simply courses through his fingers. As his heartbeat slows, he leans against a wall and slowly slumps to the floor. The light in his beautiful blue eyes dims. The boy gazes into them quietly.</p><p>He does so for a very long time. When he finally comes back to reality, the man is no longer breathing. Sheets of paper from the file are scattered at his feet. He picks up one blood-soaked page and looks it over. It is a list of all the children who had been abducted. The plan had been in place for some time, long enough that many of his superiors and fellow soldiers were likely victims of it. They had been stolen from other countries, incorporated into a new nation, and given fake lives—just as he had been. Unable to collect his chaotic thoughts, he finds himself presented with a cruel truth: By killing a man who was supposed to be on his side, he finds himself with nothing left to trust. Not his country, not his fellow soldiers, and not even himself.</p><p>Anger. Sadness. Unease. Fear. Hate.</p><p>All these emotions swirl and churn in his heart.</p><p>“So then… What should I live for?”</p><p>The words that spill from his quivering lips are quickly swallowed up by the darkness.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>The summer night swelters. The air is still. A roar of flame climbs over the darkened suburbs and into the starry sky.</p><p>The labor camp beyond the barbed wire burns.</p><p>An alarm signals an emergency.</p><p>“We’re under attack!” cry the guards.</p><p>The workers’ footsteps become a frenzied pounding as they seek escape. The sudden fires throw the inside of the building into chaos. A small girl of meager years races down the burning corridor, her wails echoing off the walls.</p><p>“Quickly! This way!”</p><p>A guard grabs her hand and attempts to pull her away. His plan is to take the sobbing girl away from the fire and outside to safety. But instead, she looks up with frightened eyes and digs her heels in tight. Her response is understandable. For she is a worker at the camp. Her life has been a litany of abuses at the hands of the military, including guards like him. So when he grabs her hand, her fear instinct kicks in, and she is unable to move.</p><p>His irritation rising, the guard raises his voice.</p><p>“Do as I say, girl! Take advantage of the chaos and get out of—“</p><p>His words grind to a halt. The girl stares at the blade that now protrudes from his chest. Someone has stabbed him from behind with a rapier.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The guard musters what remains of his hate to turn and face the figure behind him. It is a slim young man with silver hair. In his fading consciousness, the guard recalls a wanted poster he has seen countless times. It showed the image of the young man who now stands before him; of this there is no doubt. The army has been searching for him, for he leads a group of insurgents who attack labor camps such as this. And it is him and his people who caused this chaos.</p><p>The bloodied blade slides from the guard’s body. His corpse slips into a puddle of blood on the ground.</p><p>“Nnngh…”</p><p>The girl trembles to see the tragic sight before her. Her legs are heavy weights. The young man wipes his bloody blade on the fallen guard’s clothes before turning his attention to the girl.</p><p>“Come on. We’re getting out of here.”</p><p>There is one reason he and his comrades attack the army’s forced-labor camps:</p><p>They seek to free children captured by the Infant Abduction Strategy and absorb them into their ranks.</p><p>The Infant Abduction Strategy.</p><p>It is a secret operation in which this country’s army kidnaps genetically superior children from foreign countries and trains them to be soldiers. Those who prove ill-suited for warfare are instead thrown into labor camps. The young man was abducted as part of this operation. And though he fought for his new country for a short time, he deserted once he learned the truth of his background. Now, he attacks their camps alongside those who are also fueled by a desire for revenge, freeing the laborers before taking them in as companions.</p><p>One day, he will find and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the man who tore him from his parents and made his life a misery. But in order to accomplish this task, he needs fighters of his own.</p><p>A dozen or so of his people wait for him outside the burning camp. The children who had been working there gather around them. As the young man sends the girl over to the others, one of his compatriots—a man with freckles—offers a report:</p><p>“He’s still not back.”</p><p>He<br> is one of their fellows who often acts outside of orders.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>Unable to hide his irritation, the young man clicks his tongue.</p><p>“What’s the plan?” asked the freckled man.</p><p>Even if they decide to launch a search, the camp is engulfed in flame. And while they are safe at the moment, enemy reinforcements are surely on the way. But…</p><p>“Take the kids and get out of here. I’ll catch up.”</p><p>There is no hesitation in the young man’s voice. Once he finishes speaking, he steps back inside the burning camp. Flames billow in every corner. Superheated air burns in his lungs. But the young man with silver hair continues to search for his compatriot—and at last, he finds him.</p><p>A boy sits on the ground, his back leaning against the wall. His pitch-black hair—a rare feature in this part of the world—shines brightly in the light of the billowing flames. He has taken a gunshot wound to his leg—but though it has rendered him immobile, it does not appear fatal. The young man sighs in relief before offering a cutting remark:</p><p>“Pretty sure this wasn’t where I ordered you to be.”</p><p>“I’m not apologizing.”</p><p>The black-haired boy is defiant. His gaze drops to the dead soldiers scattered on the ground around him.</p><p>“I don’t care about saving kids; I just want to kill as many of these bastards as I can.”</p><p>After being taken through the Infant Abduction Strategy, the boy was deemed ill-suited for combat and sent to a labor camp. He now harbors a deep hatred for the soldiers that abused him. As his leader, the young man finds this desire for revenge to be the height of selfishness. But he reprimands the boy no further. Instead, he slings him over his shoulders and silently moves back up the flaming corridor.</p><p>Eventually, he manages four words:</p><p>“I’m glad you survived.”</p><p>They fall from his mouth without warning. The young man understands why his subordinate acts as he does. When he was part of the army, he also made the same mistakes over and over in an attempt to avenge his parents. And every time, it was his captain and squadmates who pulled him from the fire.</p><p>The black-haired boy reminds the young man<br>so<br> much of his earlier self. And when he thinks of it that way, he finds he cannot abandon him to fate.</p><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>When he was yet small, the young man’s parents were killed by an enemy army, after which he became a soldier so he might avenge them.</p><p>But…</p><p>Once his revenge was complete, he was forced to face an empty truth:</p><p>Those he believed were his parents were actually not. They were merely a couple attempting to raise a kidnapped child into the perfect soldier.</p><p>And…</p><p>The person he killed to avenge his parents was his true father.</p><p>On that day, he found his resolve. He would seek out and kill the man who devised the Infant Abduction Strategy. The top-secret military operation that had ruined his life. So he gathered people who harbored the same resentment, a group that grew more powerful by the day. They made their headquarters in a corner of a destitute area, acting as a kind of vigilante group in the region.</p><p>Violence had once been a staple of life in the area, but since the young man and his group arrived, it had grown safe enough for children to play outdoors.</p><p>But…</p><p>Today, things are different. A symphony of gunshots and heavy bootheels fills the air. The young man’s compatriots fall in a hail of bullets, their bodies trampled without mercy. Innocent villagers are caught in the crossfire. The group has attacked so many labor camps that the enemy army was finally able to locate their headquarters. As the young man shouts orders in an attempt to repel the siege, the gears in his head continue to turn.</p><p>The enemy had marched right into their stronghold without activating any traps or setting off even a single alarm. Even the best-trained soldiers could not accomplish such a feat. It’s as if they knew exactly where to step. Is it possible? Could someone on the inside be providing them intelligence?</p><p>As doubt scrambles for purchase in the young man’s heart, he shakes his head. Everyone on his side fights for the same objective; none would ever do such a thing. He shouts another order and draws his sword. As he does, the freckled man rushes to his side.</p><p>“I’ll hold them off,” he says. “Take any who can still fight and get out of here.”</p><p>The young man opens his mouth, thinking to reject the man’s proposed course of action. But he falters under the man’s straightforward gaze. The freckled man continues:</p><p>“We need you to live.”</p><p>His eyes bear down on the young man with determination and confidence. He will entrust all that is left to him so he might accomplish their mission: revenge on those who ruined their lives with the Infant Abduction Strategy.</p><p>And…</p><p>He could not find it in his heart to betray the resolve of his compatriots. That is the answer the young man arrived at.</p><p>He takes any who can still move and escapes the burning stronghold. Dawn is still a distant dream. The remaining dozen or so fighters sit together in a remote ruin and speak of what is to come. They have somehow evaded any pursuers along the way. But the army knows the direction in which they took flight, so they cannot escape them for long. And yet, the young man can’t let the responsibility he has been entrusted with go to waste.</p><p>“We need to kill the man in charge of the Infant Abduction Strategy before we’re found. Only then will our revenge be complete.”</p><p>They know their target is stationed in a domestic military facility. The young man produces a sketched set of facility blueprints they obtained for just this moment, then begins laying our their plan in a hoarse voice. The remaining dozen or so fighters will infiltrate the facility and kill key military personnel. It is a plan most reckless. But if they are going to be tracked down and cornered anyway, fighting is a better option than running. Or at least, that’s how the young man sees it.</p><p>“I’m not asking you to come with me,” he continues. “I want as many of you to survive as—“</p><p>“I’m going.”</p><p>Who interrupts, other than the black-haired boy? The one who acts of his own accord; the one who has caused the young man no end of grief.</p><p>“I didn’t stick with you all this time to<br>survive<br>,” says the boy. “I did it for revenge.”</p><p>When he speaks, the rest nod in determination before raising their voices in support of the plan. And though the young man has nowhere left to turn, he at least has his comrades. Dawn breaks. Faint light flickers in through rural foliage. The silver-haired young man and black-haired boy patrol the area around the ruins in which they hide. Suddenly, the boy comes to a halt, staring up at the vanishing stars. The gruff air he typically carries has faded into the shadows.</p><p>“If we fail, we’ll die,” he murmurs.</p><p>“Pretty much,” replies the young man.</p><p>“But what happens if we succeed?”</p><p>The boy levels his gaze on the young man.</p><p>“I’ve always wondered that: How am I supposed to live once I have my revenge?”</p><p>The young man has no answer. At first, he lived to exact revenge on the foreign soldier who killed his parents, only to learn the man was actually his real father. Since that day, he has lived for revenge on those who kidnapped him as a part of the Infant Abduction Strategy. That thought alone carries him through the endless days of fighting. Now that he thinks about it, vengeance has been his<br>entire<br> reason for living. He has forgotten what it is like to live without it.</p><p>“We’ll figure it out once it’s over,” says the young man finally. “Until then, we just need to survive.”</p><p>The black-haired boy gives a sad smile unlike his typical brusque self.</p><p>And…</p><p>The young man returns from patrol and falls into his bunk. When he wakes up, he finds the boy gone. All that remains are his belongings. They search his bag and find a single piece of paper. Written on it is the day’s temperature and weather, as well as a description of the townsfolk. The boy’s comrades tilt their head at the nonsensical letter. Why has he left this? But the young man understands.</p><p>“It’s a code.”</p><p>It is terribly similar to one the military uses, which means they cannot decipher it without a matching decoder. But the question the young man had is now solved. The army had known exactly what to expect when they attacked, and that was most certainly due to…</p><p>The young man decides to accept his betrayal.</p><p>But…<br>He remembers how sad the boy’s smile was at dawn. The image is seared into his mind. He will never forget it.</p><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>The young man wades through waist-deep water along with a dozen or so of his compatriots.</p><p>In the dead of night, they are making their way through a sewer. It connects to a canal that surrounds the military facility, and is the optimal path for sneaking in while avoiding detection.</p><p>Their destination is the facility’s control room. The man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy—the program that took them from their homelands and ruined their lives—should be waiting there. They will kill him, and in doing so have their revenge. That is their plan.</p><p>The sewers are silent, save for the occasional ripple of disturbed water. The enemy does not seem to know they are there. But they all know that is likely not the case, and so proceed with the utmost caution. The black-haired boy always acted on his own accord. He left proof he had been working with the enemy before vanishing from the group. But before he did so, they informed him of their plan to infiltrate the facility. Though the young man changed the date, time, and route of the operation, it is likely the black-haired boy told the army enough for them to be on alert. This will doubtless be the most difficult of fights.</p><p>At last, they arrive at a ladder leading to the surface. The young man turns to his allies and speaks in a heavy tone. He tells them there is one thing he has to do before killing the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. He must find the boy who vanished after leaving proof of his betrayal and ask him<br>why<br>.</p><p>The young man continues:</p><p>“If he really was communicating with the enemy, he wouldn’t have left proof for us to find.”</p><p>“I saw in his eyes how much he hated our enemy. None of that was false.”</p><p>Even now, he trusts the black-haired boy. For he is just as reckless as the young man used to be. The young man knows his request to find the boy is selfish; they don’t even know if he is in the facility at all.</p><p>“Anyway, I won’t ask any of you come with me,” concludes the young man as he casts his gaze downward. The rest of his group chuckles.</p><p>“We’ve always known how selfish you are, yet we chose to stick by your side. We burn with the same need for revenge as you, yet we also know the boy wouldn’t betray us without some reason.”</p><p>These are their words. While the need for revenge may be the warped strand that keeps their group together, they also have a firm bond of trust.</p><p>“Thank you,” says the young man.</p><p>Together, they climb the ladder and move into the base. The group had steeled themselves for a battle against uncountable enemy soldiers, but security is unnaturally lax.</p><p>“They’ll be here any second! Send out the patrols and ready for a counterattack!”</p><p>Hearing enemy soldiers yelling orders, the group freezes in place and attempts to get a better idea of what is happening.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Intruders! Intru—“</p><p>The guard’s voice suddenly cuts off of amidst a burst of gunfire. The group has no idea what is happening, which makes the situation all the more dangerous. Yet they have no choice but to take advantage of the chaos and act. They carve a path with blade and bullet, proceeding through the base in search of the black-haired boy. Their destination is the control room, where the young man feels certain he will be found.</p><p>His trust in the boy has not wavered; not even when presented with proof of his betrayal. His heart is bound not by logic, but by faith, and it now tells him where to go.</p><p>And then…</p><p>As the group nears the control room, their eyes widen at the terrible sight before them. Bodies of dead soldiers lie scattered across the quiet hallway. Bullet holes scar the walls around them. The young man has an awful feeling in his gut. His heart pounds in his ears. He takes a moment to calm his breathing, then begins to follow the trail of blood.</p><p>Silence hangs heavily around them. Not a single guard stands watch outside the control room—the place where the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy should be. At a wordless signal from the young man, his companions batter down the door.</p><p>But…</p><p>The room is silent. There is no sign of the enemy leader they are looking for. Instead, there is someone else lying on the floor. His black hair is matted with blood. Breath rattles in his chest as life slowly abandons him. The young man’s eyes widen. As one, the group breaks into a dash and rushes over to the boy.</p><p>“H-hey, boss…”</p><p>The corner of the boy’s mouth, thick with blood, quirks upward in a half-smile. The young man crouches down and tells him not to speak. As he inspects his wounds, his mind whirls, wondering if there is a way to save him. But his body is riddled with bullets; everyone can see his time is nearly gone. The boy croaks out a hoarse voice, apologizing for his actions before attempting to explain.</p><p>The enemy had approached him, offering to put him in contact with his real parents if he turned traitor. But when the army invaded the destitute district and began slaughtering people indiscriminately, he immediately regretted his decision. So he turned his coat again, using his position as their mole to infiltrate the facility and kill the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. It…did not go well.</p><p>As the young man listens to this tale of regret, a thought comes to him: Perhaps they should not forgive the boy for divulging information to the enemy.</p><p>But…</p><p>Would he have done differently in his place? The young man is not so sure. Can he blame the boy for being led astray because of a desire to find happiness with his family?</p><p>“It’s fine,” says the young man. “Don’t worry. I’ll finish the job.”</p><p>“Thanks… And maybe one day…”</p><p>A melancholy smile spreads across the black-haired boy’s face.</p><p>“You can tell me what comes after revenge…”</p><p>His words stop. He lies still. The young man watches as his life ends, then quietly gets to his feet. They must keep going. Vengeance will not wait. The boy has killed the guards and plunged the facility into chaos. They cannot waste this opportunity.</p><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Children Crossing the Twilight, Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>The black-haired boy infiltrated the military facility as a mole. But after pretending to serve them, he bore his fangs and killed countless guards, causing chaos to descend upon the facility. And though he ultimately perished… His compatriots and allies followed the path he carved and successfully reached the core of the facility.</p><p>Now, they continue searching for the man responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy. An inhumane project wherein the country kidnaps children from neighboring lands to raise as either soldiers or laborers. The boy and his companions are victims of this operation, and their goal is to kill this man and get their revenge.</p><p>Dawn approaches. At the gate behind the facility, several shadowy figures mill about in the dark.</p><p>“Why aren’t the damned reinforcements here yet!?”</p><p>The man who cursed wears a uniform decorated with several medals. He is the person responsible for the Infant Abduction Strategy, and he now runs a nervous hand through his long beard. Unable to hide his irritation in the face of his guards’ failure, he is resorting to chewing out his subordinates.</p><p>“The reinforcements will be here in less than ten minutes, sir,” one of his personal retinue tells him. He gestures to a waiting car, inviting the man inside. They will ferry him away to a safe place until the commotion dies down.</p><p>But…</p><p>Gunshots ring out. Bullets pierce the guards’ heads, sending blood flying. The man realizes what is going on, but by the time he attempts to make his escape, it is far too late. The thin blade of a rapier suddenly pierces his neck from behind, its steel shimmering in the pale light of night. The man feels cold spreading across his body, as well as fear of his upcoming demise.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of a young man whispers low in his ear:</p><p>“You have no right to mourn your death; my friends all faced more gruesome ends because of you.”</p><p>He then begins to speak of all of the lives he’s seen ruined because of the Infant Abduction Strategy. The children who grew into soldiers, forever ignorant of their pasts. Those children locked in dark, cramped rooms and forced to labor until their last breath. And those who learned of the top-secret operation and met their ends as a result.</p><p>As the boy quakes with fury, the man attempts to articulate an apology. But the boy cuts him off.</p><p>“Not to me. Apologize to the dead.”</p><p>And with that, the man’s light goes out forever. The young man has found his revenge, but in so doing has lost his path home. The rest of his allies had volunteered to hold off the enemy and catch up later, granting the young man a path to vengeance. But none of them have arrived. Instead, all that follows the young man as he flees are reinforcements sent by the military.</p><p>Several hours have passed since he escaped the facility. The sky lightens, the sun gradually starting to show its face. Though the young man hid every time he encountered the enemy, he has taken numerous bullets, and his body now nears its end.</p><p>He rests on his knees, alone in the shade of a building. The blood that flees his body reddens the ground as it greets the dawn. As the young man sits beneath the rising sun, he feels his consciousness fade.</p><p>And yet, he does not mind such an end.</p><p>His revenge is complete.</p><p>It is all over.</p><p>……</p><p>…………</p><p>………………</p><p>“I’m glad you survived.”</p><p>There comes a voice from the darkness. It is an old voice, one he heard many times in the past, and one that comes with many memories.

Their objective was to kill the man behind the Infant Abduction Strategy. And while they accomplished their objective, reports claim they paid for it with their lives. The Infant Abduction Strategy was the military’s best-kept secret—its existence unknown to all but a few in power—and they attempted to clean it up in secret.</p><p>However, one soldier blew the whistle on the inhumane methods of the operation, and was quickly labeled a hero. As a result, the vice-like grip the military once held over the government is now in decline.</p><p>And now…</p><p>A lonely young man walks atop an abandoned railroad, flanked on either side by rows of sunflowers. His body is scarred with signs of battle; he had once been so consumed by vengeance that he became a soldier.</p><p>He is the one who led the revolt. Reports claim all the children involved in the incident had perished. But he alone had been saved by a hero. He alone survived. He walks along the old railroad. He walks by himself, no blade or pistol at his hip, in search of what comes after revenge.</p><p>This is his path.</p><p>Summer is coming to an end.</p><p>A cool breeze dances among the flowers.<br>As though gently encouraging him forward.</p><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Sweltering Bonds<br>[<br>]</p><p>I walk along a dilapidated railroad lined by endless fields of sunflowers. High above, an uncaring sun rages against a brilliant blue sky, turning the rows of blossoms into paint-smeared streaks of yellow.</p><p>Oh, how I hate it all.</p><p>Time is an illusion here. Hunger a constant companion. My steps fall one after the other after the other, until I finally see a tunnel begin to materialize in the heat-shimmer distance. And on the other side of it, a foreign city.</p><p>This country used to kidnap children in an effort to improve its gene pool, you see. And while the victims were spirited from countries across the world, the majority came from the city at the other end of this tunnel—the city that is my true home. And that is why I walk through the pain and the smells and the hunger and the heat: in the hope it all somehow leads me to the truth.</p><p>A woman stands at the tunnel entrance. She’s maybe in her mid-40s, with a staff in her hand. Her steely eyes stare unblinkingly at the sunflowers, but as I attempt to slip past, she spins around and whips a blade out of the top of her staff. I manage to block it with my own, and we stand there a moment, frozen in time.</p><p>“What business does a soldier have in a place like this?” she asks, ire in her voice. “I know that sword you hold. It took the lives of countless numbers of my countrymen.”</p><p>In truth, I’d brought the sword with me when I deserted the army, which is why it has a military insignia on the scabbard. To me, it’s just a weapon—but to this woman, it is the sign of her most hated enemy.</p><p>“Found it on the ground,” I say casually. Clearly unconvinced by my answer, she makes her move. Our blades begin to ring back and forth in a blur of iron and steel. Her blows are relentless, her strength otherworldly. Any advantage I may have had is long gone, and as I desperately attempt to fend her off, she lands a firm blow on the pit of my stomach, crumpling me to the ground.</p><p>The woman looms over me, blocking out that brilliant blue sky. She raises her blade above her head and prepares to claim my life, but before she can act, another voice calls out from inside the tunnel.</p><p>“Captain! Enemy approaching!”</p><p>An enemy attack? No. Oh, no.</p><p>As my attacker lowers her weapon and turns to face this new threat, I manage to tilt my head toward the disturbance. It’s a squadron of soldiers all dressed in the familiar uniform of my old intel corps. Were they here for<br>me<br>? Did they really follow me all the way out here?</p><p>“Beat them back!” cries the captain. “Do not let them touch the sunflowers!”</p><p>On her command, armed villagers pour out of the tunnel and begin battling my old companions. They fight well, these commoners—better than I would have expected. But before I can see more, the pain of my wounds floods through me, turning the sounds of gunfire and screams into the hush of distant rain on a windowpane before fading out altogether.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Sunflower Child<br>[<br>]</p><p>“You don’t have much of a talent for housework, I see.”</p><p>This scolding comes as I sweep the living room, and I turn to see the owner of this house: the same captain who attacked me on the railroad two days prior. She was permitting me to stay in a spare room by way of apology for injuring me—which would have been a kinder gesture had she not also demanded that I clean and run errands to pay for room and board.</p><p>“I’m leaving for patrol. Make sure you clean every inch of this place. Got it?”</p><p>This border city lives in constant danger of invasion, and the captain leads a militia that helps to keep it safe. She apparently attacked me because she thought I was the enemy—a mistake put to rights the moment she saw my former intel companions arrive and attempt to kill me. Regardless, I’ve had enough of this arrangement; I’m going to leave this house tonight if it’s the last thing I do. But as I whip the broom around and send dust flying through the air, the air is split by a sudden thunder so loud it almost tears my ears from their moorings.</p><p>Shaking the cobwebs free, I rush to a nearby window and see a cannon firing a giant ball of water high into the sky. The unusual missile flies through the air and tunnel before bursting apart and showing the fields of sunflowers on either side of the railroad tracks. The droplets glitter as they fall through the blue, and I find myself utterly entranced by the sight.</p><p>“We lost so many children,” murmurs the captain behind me.</p><p>“So many stolen from us. We planted a sunflower for every one of them.”</p><p>As she says this, I realize one of those flowers was planted for me. On the heels of that, I suddenly imagine a man looking at the flowers and thinking of his kidnapped child. He’s a soldier—the same one I killed to take revenge for my family. But in truth, the parents I had cared for and loved so dearly were the same people who kidnapped me from my home all those years ago. And the other man? The one I killed for revenge?</p><p>Well, he was my true father.</p><p>“So many of us are still waiting for their sunflowers to come home. Even now. Even still.”</p><p>The woman’s voice brings me back to reality, but I don’t want to see the shadow I know is clouding her eyes. So instead of replying, I look away—because I don’t have the time or patience to deal with such nonsense.</p><p>When midnight arrives, I gather my things and leave the house. My injuries were manageable, and I’d had more than my share of chores—but more importantly, I wanted to learn more about the abductions. After walking for a while, I come to one of the city’s main avenues and spy the captain hurrying along with a lantern in her hand.</p><p>My curiosity piqued, I hide in the shadows and follow the bouncing glow of her lamp until we arrive at the other side of the tunnel, where she walks over to a sunflower and begins to whisper to herself. But the night is still, and her hush carries to my position. It’s a name—the same name, said in a rush over and over and over again.</p><p>I take a step backward.</p><p>Two.</p><p>I don’t want to believe what I’m hearing, but my ears do not lie. Because the name the captain is repeating to the uncaring night?</p><p>It’s mine.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Sin’s Shadow<br>[<br>]</p><p>I set the bucket down next to the cannon and attempt to stretch the cricks out of my back. Every morning, this cannon fires water across the sky and over the sunflowers that stand sentinel at the entrance to the city. But all that water doesn’t carry itself, so it’s the job of the town militia to fill the buckets and carry them up and down, up and down, over and over again. And as the newest member of the militia, I’m now achingly familiar with exactly how lousy the job is.</p><p>“Thanks for the help, new guy,” says a brawny man as he picks up my bucket. He dumps it into the cannon with a practiced hand, then turns to me and smiles.</p><p>“This might get loud.”</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion rings out, sending a sphere of water flying towards the edge of the city. As I look down from the platform upon which we’re perched, I see children playing on an abandoned train car; they look up and cheer with delight as the orb soars overhead.</p><p>“Captain started this whole cannon business six months ago,” says my burly companion as we wipes sweat from his forehead. “Thought she was nuts at first, but now it’s the highlight of everyone’s day. Go figure.”</p><p>“Well, I still think it’s nuts. Haven’t you people ever heard of a hose?”</p><p>The other man grins. “This ain’t about being efficient; Captain wants to prove that weapons can be used for more than just killing. Came up with the idea right around the time her husband dies in battle, so maybe that’s where it came from.”</p><p>The captain’s husband? He was my real father—and the very man I killed. But I can’t let on to this, so I give a vague mumble in reply and climb down from the observation deck. There’s still plenty of work to be done, after all.</p><p>In the afternoon, I head to the market with the captain to purchase items for soldiers who’ve been injured in battle. Once we pick up whatever they need, we’ll bring it to them ourselves. Between hauling water and playing delivery boy, this is easily the most boring militia I’ve ever heard of—and yet, I find myself sticking around.</p><p>“I’ve got this one,” I say, taking a package from the captain’s hands.</p><p>“I don’t need your help,” she says sternly before breaking out into the smile that I’d started seeing more and more over the past few weeks. “But…I appreciate it.”</p><p>Later, we arrive at the soldiers’ homes with the provisions. The captain hands them over and engages with each and every person in conversation. I’ve never been much for idle chit-chat, so I pass the time by loitering in the yard.</p><p>After several such visits, we come to a house where she stays inside much longer than usual. From where I stand, it seems to be a conversation between friends; the patter is rapid, and I hear frequent peals of laughter from the pair of them.</p><p>After waiting around for what I consider to be a generous period of time, I finally lose my patience and storm into the house to hurry things along. But when my eyes lock onto the other person in the room—a man with a prosthetic leg—the laughter suddenly stops. The joy and color drains from the man’s face as an ominous mood settles over the room.</p><p>“YOU!” cries the man. With a speed that belies his injury, he leaps from the couch, tackles me to the floor, and wraps his hand around my throat. “I’ll never forget you! Never! NEVER!”</p><p>“Stop it! Get off him!”</p><p>The captain wraps her arms around the man and yanks him off me as he continues to protest. I want to tell him to stop—I want to<br>scream.<br> But my breath has abandoned me, and all I can do is pray that it returns.</p><p>“He’s the one, Captain! He’s the enemy soldier who killed your husband!”</p><p>Silence. Deafening. Eternal.</p><p>“Is this true?” asks the captain with a trembling voice. I want to respond, but my body is shaking too hard. I’ve never been this scared—not in any battle, not from any man. The silence grows and thickens until it feels like it will smother the life out of the three of us and leave nothing behind but dust.</p><p>“Get out of here. Leave. I don’t ever want to see your face again.”</p><p>I start to stammer something—some pathetic explanation—but she turns to me with blade in hand, just as she did the first day we met. Yet the look in her eyes is much fiercer that it was then; a wild thing that shows a person on the edge of losing everything that might possibly make her human.</p><p>“NOW!”</p><p>My quivering legs somehow propel me out of the house and through the streets of town. I curse my stupidity as I run, bemoaning how I’d stayed with the captain in some pathetic attempt to repent for how I’d torn her life apart. But here’s the funny thing: I actually thought I could do it. I actually thought I might be able to make amends.</p><p>Ah, but that was the wish of a fool.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Midnight Flames<br>[<br>]</p><p>I urge myself forward.</p><p>One more step and my ragged breath echoes in the dark. One more step and my lungs burn pure fire. One more step. One more step. One more step.</p><p>“I don’t ever want to see your face again.”</p><p>The Captain’s words play in my brain without pause, which is why I’d originally planned to never return to the city after the night I abandoned it three months prior. But then I learned it had fallen into enemy hands, so now I am running back, running with everything I have, all so I might reach a woman who wants nothing more than to never see me again.</p><p>I finally reach the city’s rear gates and step through. Taking a deep breath, I look around, my eyes scarcely able to process what they see.</p><p>The hardy merchants who kept trading despite short supplies. The disciplined members of the militia. The children who loved to play in the abandoned train cars. All the people who once made the city a living, breathing thing are now charred corpses smoking on the ground. The world is silent and still, save for the occasional gust of wind and the uncaring crackle of flame.</p><p>Eventually, I discover the body of the brawny militia member in the rubble of what remains of the cannon. The pungent scent of gunpowder is still strong, even through it was now used to fire water. As I press on, I find only death. A familiar face here, a name on the wind there. But what I cannot seem to find is the body of the Captain—the very reason I came back in the first place.</p><p>Could it be? Is it possible?</p><p>Instinct quickly bubbles into outright conviction, and I set off at a run for the sunflowers she loved above all things. But when I emerge on the other side of the tunnel, I’m horrified to find the fields ablaze, the flowers transformed into an endless river of fire under the dark night sky. Against their light, I finally see a familiar figure lying on the tracks.</p><p>I race to the Captain’s side and take an involuntary step back, aghast. Her body is an ocean of bloody wounds, her breath a rasp. How many had she fought to get here? How many of them did it take to finally lay her low?</p><p>“I’m…sorry…”</p><p>Her mouth parts slightly as these words escape, and I drop to my knees and cradle her in my arms. She’s cold—<br>so<br> cold. How can someone be this cold when everything around us is nothing but fire and madness?</p><p>“I just wanted…to see my boy…”</p><p>Each of the sunflowers planted here represented a child that was stolen. So the Captain didn’t see them as flowers, but her son. That was why she came at the end of her life.</p><p>“I just wanted to see him…”</p><p>She repeats the phrase over and over, losing a little more of herself in the process.</p><p>“I just wanted to see him…</p><p>I just wanted to see him…</p><p>I just wanted to see him…”</p><p>But he’s here, Mom.</p><p>He’s right in front of you.</p><p>I wanted to tell her the truth, but I also knew it would make her last moments even more painful. After all, I was the same person who’d killed her husband not six months before. So instead, I hold her hand in mine and say nothing. Eventually it slips from my grasp and settles on the ground. A petal from one of the sunflowers drifts out of the fire and flutters toward us, and by the time it joins her hand on the earth, she is gone.</p><p>“I’ll come see you someday.” I whisper. “I swear it.”<br>But as sparks crackle off the sunflowers and drift away into the gloomy night, it feels like the dawn has never been so far away.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Child of Revenge<br>[<br>]</p><p>Carrier: All right, time for handoff!</p><p>Substitute: Boy…revenge…</p><p>Carrier: I see.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="F66x"><a href="#F66x" class="headerlink" title="F66x"></a>F66x</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>I think back on the past. On memories of the boy who will never come home. And on the happy family in the photo. My<br> embraces me. His warmth is the only constant in my life, and as he holds me, my chilly heart slowly melts.<br> I think. </p><p>A deafening rumble suddenly reverberates throughout the base, along with a siren. The announcement that follows tells us what we never wanted to hear: Flowers have invaded the base itself for the very first time. Cradling the photo, my husband and I dash for the exit. It would be folly to fight the Flowers unarmed, so we decide to evacuate instead.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>The base is already a stage of tragedy. Our fellow prisoners, unable to fight the sudden army of Flowers, have been decimated. Among the bodies, we hear a voice calling for help. But we know that stopping means death. So we run…and don’t look back. As we do, we offer a silent apology.</p><p>We run for our lives, but the Flowers are everywhere. Eventually, they corner us and launch their assault.<br> I think—but the expected pain never comes. Instead, my husband leaps in front of me and takes the attack in my place. Somehow, he is still alive—but he will not survive another strike. He screams at me to run, but instead, I grip the photo and step forward. </p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>Just as the Flower’s next attack is about to land, armed prisoners appear with our commander and cut it down. The defense operation has been put in motion—and somehow, the two of us are still alive. My husband’s wounds look painful, but he just chuckles and says he’s proud to have such badges of honor. I’m relieved to see he’s in good enough shape to joke. The two of us retreat with the commander. My husband’s wounds are deep and he is taken to the infirmary for surgery. I pray fervently that he will make a full recovery. I hand the photo to my husband as a good-luck charm.<br> My husband clutches it to his chest as they wheel him away.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>My heart grows cold. How much time has passed since he went in? He’d been joking around, so surely he’s going to be okay.<br> I feel like the uncertainty will crush me under its weight.</p><p>Finally, my husband emerges from the infirmary. Seeing him safe, I let out a small gasp of relief. However, he has no memory of the recent past…and the photo has also disappeared. The memory loss is due to shock, and only temporary—but no one can explain where the photo went. My husband, as if sensing my unease, wraps me up in another tight embrace. As I feel his warmth, my concerns melt away once more.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>When she was yet human</p><p>“This is a tale of the recent past.”</p><p>“A tale of a time when she was still human.”</p><p>“A tale of how Flowers were born into the world…”</p><p>“You’re going to grow up big and strong.” A woman murmurs these words to the organic matter growing inside the incubator. She operates the console with a practiced hand. Holographic panels float in the air before her, displaying detailed information on the status of the matter in the incubator. The data is diverse, covering everything from humidity and temperature to the concentration of oxygen, elemental makeup of the soil, and even thermal conductivity. Each number is one piece of a delicate dance; if one fails, the others will follow. It is difficult work, but the woman feels pride at her success thus far. Once, thousands of years in the past, Earth contained what was known as “nature.” Uncountable plants and animals flourished in ecosystems across the mountains and oceans—and they did so alongside humans. But due to human expansion and ecological pollution—as well as disasters and climate change wrought by nature itself—the ecology was weakened, and life began to sputter out. Now, the nature that once sparked plants and animals across the entire planet has been entirely lost.</p><p>The woman works in a genetic research facility. It was built with the newest and best technology available, and serves as a gathering place and laboratory for the world’s most prominent scholars and researchers. The woman, a leader in the field of genetic engineering, now concentrates all her efforts on the process of regenerating extinct plants and animals.</p><p>“You seem extra happy today,” she says to her latest experiment.</p><p>“So why don’t we give this a go?”</p><p>She flips switches and presses buttons on the console. Moments later, there is a beep and liquid sprays into the incubator. That liquid is a custom-made growth accelerant that interacts directly with DNA. The moment it lands on the organic matter, a white flower springs out of the soil.</p><p>“Yes!” cries the woman.</p><p>She permits herself a single fist pump. In truth, she wants to leap up and go dancing through the lab, but the fact she is under constant surveillance takes much of the fun out of such spontaneous celebrations. Not to mention her embarrassing incident of long ago…</p><p>“Brought another one back, did you?”</p><p>The speaker is a large, muscular man in a lab coat. Though his physique is more appropriate for a soldier, he is actually a talented scientist in his own right.</p><p>“Honey!” says the woman.</p><p>“I thought you were sleeping. But yes, come here and take a look at this.”</p><p>She and the man have been married for five years. They met in this very facility.</p><p>“It’s pretty,” murmurs the man as he bends down to get a better look at the incubator.</p><p>“What’s it called?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But according to the literature, they say finding one will grant your greatest wish.”</p><p>Though the woman would be embarrassed to admit as much, this story is the reason she chose to bring the flower back. For she has a wish she desires above all else: A wish to see the world filled with green once more. As she stares at the flower growing in the rich soil, she whispers her wish, hoping that it might hear. This world knows nothing but heartache and loss, and she wants to give it something good. It’s the reason she studied genetic engineering in the first place. And though it has been a journey of fits and starts, her plans are finally bearing fruit.</p><p>Suddenly, her thoughts are interrupted by the strident howl of an alarm, followed by a red light in the incubator. The two look inside and see the flower rapidly shriveling.</p><p>“No,” says the woman.</p><p>“No! Why is this happening!?”</p><p>She frantically rechecks the information on the panels. The numbers that represent the flower’s nutrients are all swiftly decreasing.</p><p>“Hang on. I’m going to raise the values.”</p><p>She pumps additional nutrients into the incubator—twice the normal amount. Liquid gushes out, adjusting the concentration of oxygen and the nutrients within the soil. But the flower continues to fade, its petals falling noiselessly onto the dirt below. Her husband looks at some of the numbers and furrows his brow.</p><p>“Strange. This flower is using far more energy than normal.”</p><p>It’s a calm observation, one made from the experience of seeing countless flora wither away in his own experiments. But the woman is in no mood to hear it.</p><p>I can’t let it die,<br> she thinks.<br>Not now. If it dies, my wish dies with it.</p><p>She doubles down and focuses on the console. More liquid enters the incubator’s glowing red interior.</p><p>“Come on,” she says through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Come<br>on<br>.”</p><p>“I’m not giving up on you now!”</p><p>Finally, the dripping flower begins to grow again, its fallen petals regenerating before their eyes…. But it does not stop. A moment later, the Flower smashes out of the incubator, sending tendrils and roots coiling across the floor. It almost seems to be searching for something. And it shows no signs of stopping.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>A siren begins to wail. The couple presses against a far wall, trying to escape the thing they have unleashed. The Flower continues to grow. Soon, the roots have covered the entire floor.</p><p>The walls are gone. The celling is gone. Nearly the entire room is buried in plant matter. Suddenly, several of their fellow researchers force the door open and run into the lab.</p><p>“You guys all right?” one of them asks, breathless.</p><p>“We’re fine,” says the husband.</p><p>“Just used a heavy hand with the growth accelerant, is all.”</p><p>The husband explains the situation because his wife is sitting on the floor, too stunned to speak.</p><p>Their fellow scientists express relief to know the couple is safe.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” whispers the woman.</p><p>“God, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Her husband helps her to her feet and embraces her.</p><p>“It’s all right. I’m just glad you weren’t hurt.”</p><p>His warmth melts away the tension in her heart.</p><p>“Hey, did you guys see this? It’s really interesting…” One of their coworkers is tapping the side of the Flower’s stem. Others soon gather around to make their own observations, intrigued by the situation. The stem is far tougher than that of the original plant. And its mass has clearly increased. But it didn’t do so through multiplying cells—rather, it has simply increased in size.</p><p>“Hang on. What’s this?”</p><p>One scientist is staring at the petals.</p><p>“Guys, look. I think there’s something in here.”</p><p>“Wait, it could be dangerous,” says the woman.</p><p>“No, it’s okay. I’m just going to…”</p><p>“W-wait… My arm! It’s got my arm!”</p><p>The man’s voice begins to grow panicked. He’s clearly not joking. Suddenly, he lets out a horrifying wail. The other researchers attempt to pry the petals open, but they are hard as stone and won’t so much as budge.</p><p>“Help me!” screams the man.</p><p>“Oh god, SOMEONE HELP ME!”</p><p>The Flower begins to pull the man inside. His coworkers desperately try to free him, but they might as well be pulling a mountain.</p><p>“H-help… Heeelp meeeeee…”</p><p>The man is gone. From inside the now swollen corolla comes the sounds of something straining and cracking. Then it flies open and sprays blood across the entire room. A hunk of flesh—the remains of their coworker—flies out and tumbles across the floor. As they watch, horrified, a new Flower springs up from the meat. The germinated Flower grows just as rapidly as its kin, causing the meat to shrink at the same time.</p><p>“My god…” says the woman.</p><p>“It’s absorbing the nutrients.”</p><p>With the meat depleted, the Flower begins to squirm and writhe across the floor in search of a new source of food.</p><p>“Run!” someone yells.</p><p>“Get the hell out of here!”</p><p>The researchers dash away as one.</p><p>The screams continue. The Flowers pursue the survivors, slithering over the floor like snakes with petals for heads. Each time one of the petals consumes a victim, a new Flower sprouts from the remains. Their numbers grow. And grow. And<br>grow<br>.</p><p>“Here! Hide in here!”</p><p>The husband pulls the woman into a small closet in the corner of the research division.</p><p>They force their ragged breaths to slow as they try to remain quiet. Outside, the sounds of slithering and screams are everywhere.</p><p>“What have I done?”</p><p>This was my experiment. My flower. And now it’s eating people.</p><p>Was it a dangerous plant that should never have been revived?</p><p>Was it the fault of the growth accelerant I formulated?</p><p>Before she can wonder more, her husband pulls her close.</p><p>“Right now, we just need to survive.”</p><p>His embrace drives the fear and doubt from her mind. Her shivering slowly comes to a stop.</p><p>But the sounds outside continue without pause, and they know they do not have long. Suddenly, her husband lets her go and reaches for the door.</p><p>“Hang on, honey. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Before she can say anything, he bolts from the closet, seals the door behind him, and runs down the hall while making as much noise as he possibly can. It’s clear he’s trying to lure them away.<br>No, please… Please don’t leave me here alone…</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Time passes—she has no idea how much. Eventually, the slithers and screams die off, leaving the facility enrobed in an unnatural silence. She attempts to leave the closet, but the door is locked. The woman feels her body growing cold, perhaps due to fear and guilt. All she can do is wait and pray for her husband to return. Ironically, they had met in this very closet.</p><p>Her arms had been piled with equipment that day, and she was unable to work the knob. Suddenly, her gallant knight swooped in and opened the door for her.</p><p>“Maybe leave a few things behind next time, ya dope,” he’d said with a chuckle. Oh, she had been mad. More than mad—<br>furious<br>. But as he continued to assist her from time to time, she found herself becoming attracted to him. She had a tendency to get lost in her research, sometimes even forgetting to sleep and eat, but he was always there to support her.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice snaps her back to reality.</p><p>“…There? Is anyone there?” The woman leaps to her feet and starts pounding on the door.</p><p>“Here!” she cries. “I’m in here!” Footsteps pound into place outside the closet. She hears radio calls, breathing, muttered commands.</p><p>“We’re going to cut through the door. Stand back.”</p><p>A glowing red dot appears in the center of the door, sending up smoke. Soon, the high-temperature cutter begins slicing a hole in the steel. When it is halfway done, she peeks through the opening and beholds a horrible sight. The walls, floors, and ceiling of the facility have had furrows gouged into them by the snaking movements of the Flowers. And within each furrow is tightly packed meat that oozes fresh blood. Bodies that weren’t absorbed had been ground into paste by the sheer bulk of the Flowers. The woman can’t even tell who they used to be. But when the smell hits her, she turns aside and vomits.</p><p>“You all right, ma’am?”</p><p>The voice comes from a soldier looking at her through the hole in the door. He’s covered head-to-toe in thick black armor and holds an imposing beam rifle in his hand. He looks to be ready for war. The woman nods, wipes her mouth with a shaking hand, and crawls out through the hole.</p><p>The smell is worse out here.<br>Much<br> worse. And it brings everything rushing back: The screams of pain. The snapping of bones. The delight of the Flowers as they ate. She can hear and see it all over again. She turns to the side and vomits once more, but all that comes out is a stream of yellow bile. Her body has nothing left to give.</p><p>“W-were there any others survivors?” asks the woman, hoping against hope for a miracle. The soldiers just shake their heads. The hues of despair grow darker. But she cannot stay here. Not when he might be alive. Not when he might need her help.</p><p>“I’m coming with you,” she says. “I need to find my husband.”</p><p>“Oh, and I know every inch of this facility, so I can guide you wherever you need to go.”</p><p>After a brief conference, the solders bring her along. Eventually, they arrive at the most heavily damaged area. This is Research Block 21—the location of the woman’s lab. It’s as if someone redecorated the room to look like a version of Hell. Everything, from the floors to the ceiling, is painted red: Blood from the birth of a Flower. How many of her coworkers had been consumed? How many had she<br>killed<br>? The guilt chills her to the bone.</p><p>Suddenly, a deep bellow rumbles out. Something is coming their way. Something massive.</p><p>“In positions, now!”</p><p>The soldiers raise rifles to shoulders as the enemy approaches. It’s a Flower—one far bigger than any they’ve seen before. It is the most horrible sight imaginable. The petals are imprinted with the faces of victims. Not one face or two—but<br>dozens<br>. But the military captain pays this no mind.</p><p>“All units…fire.” The world dissolves into a hail of gunfire. The Flower begins to scream.</p><p>My god… It sounds human. Could it really have evolved human traits so quickly?<br> Above the crackle and roar of the firefight, the woman hears a most familiar voice. And when she looks at the Flower again, she sees the face of her love.</p><p>“Stop! Don’t shoot him!”</p><p>She rushes for a nearby soldier, but he pays her no mind. Her pleas go unheard. Her actions are meaningless. Her husband is gone. Knowing this, she breaks down into sobs.<br>This is my fault. It’s all my fault.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>When the fighting stops, the Flower lies unmoving on the ground. The woman cradles her dead husband and continues to apologize. She does so until her voice finally fails her.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Hope’s Barren Flower Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>Months go by. They thought they’d dispatched the Flowers that day…. But they were wrong. Another Flower had been found. Then another. And another. The Flowers sow seeds soon after they are born. It is all anyone can talk about anymore. The news is nothing but death figures and horrible stories. And those who manage to escape often find they have no home to return to. The Flowers evolve. They adapt. They increase their reproductive rates, perfect their strategy, and soon are the greatest disaster the world has ever known.</p><p>“…No. No! NO!”</p><p>Enraged, the woman smashes her hand against the console. Her cheeks are hollow; her eyes darkened pits. She can’t remember the last time she slept. Currently, she is working in a small laboratory constructed by another organization. Their only goal is to find a way to stop the Flowers. As the sole survivor from the research facility, leadership of this fight had fallen on her shoulders. She was locked away and tasked with analyzing Flower carcasses in order to find a chemical solution that could kill them. For a time, it looked like their quest would be successful—but the Flowers quickly evolved a resistance to the solution. Each time they created a new chemical, the Flowers adapted to counter it.</p><p>Now, she stands before a Flower in a massive incubator. On its petals she sees the faces of her coworkers and husband. Her mind has whirled with thoughts since that day. Were they things she should not wish for? Did they go against nature? Was all of this technology too powerful for humans? She has thought about putting herself out of her misery. But when she thinks of what her husband went through, she finds herself driven by the need for redemption. But this, too, is coming to an end. It has been five days since her liaison with the outside world stopped arriving. Perhaps he decided the research was fruitless and walked away. Perhaps a Flower killed him. Her food supplies are gone, yet she feel strangely at ease. She wonders idly if her senses are beginning to break down. From a distance, she hears the approaching footsteps of the reaper.</p><p>“Honey…”</p><p>Her husband floats in the incubator, fully merged with the Flower. If she was just doing this to die a failure in the end, it would have been better to become part of the petals with him.</p><p>But I know you wouldn’t give up.<br> She stands up once more, fighting off the despair in her heart.</p><p>And then…an idea. She fiddles with the console, a faint smile on her face. Perhaps it is folly—or perhaps it is the only way they will ever be able to kill the Flowers.</p><p>Days pass. The liaison never arrives. The woman is skin and bones, barely able to move. She stands before the incubator with an inscrutable expression and stares at the thing inside. There, floating in the tank, is a couple. She had combined the genes of people and Flowers to create clones of herself and her husband. With a shaking hand, she operates the console. The liquid in the incubator drains away, and the couple awakens.</p><p>“Your name is F66x.”</p><p>“Your name is 063y.”</p><p>“Together, you will eliminate the Flowers from this world.”</p><p>The couple nods silently. No matter how many times they might be stricken with despair… No matter how many times they meet a cruel end… They will be reborn again, and throw themselves into battle with the hated Flowers anew. That is how they will achieve victory—and how the woman will gain her redemption. And so, she gives her cloned self its first order: “Kill me.”</p><p>The clone nods silently and wraps its hands around her neck. As fingers tighten, consciousness slips away. Yet the woman wears an expression of utter peace.</p><p>Decades pass. The Flowers can infinitely reproduce. The clones can infinitely reproduce. Their war rages on to this day. And in the midst of this neverending battle, nature begins to take root within the empty cities.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Change (My) Life<br>[<br>]</p><p>The only sounds in the empty room are a metronomic beeping and the quiet breathing of my husband. He is bound to the bed, his entire body wired to a machine that controls his body temperature, heart rate, and all other life functions. Next to him, a young officer speaks softly to me.</p><p>“He acquired confidential information again, Commander. This is his eight instance of unauthorized access to such intelligence.”</p><p>As she speaks, details of my husband’s previous infractions appear on a nearby wall screen. I’m not surprised; it’s always been like this. Whenever he sees a chance, he breaks into some area deep within the base and steals classified data about the Flowers.</p><p>“I’m sorry Commander, but I can’t cover for him anymore.”</p><p>Commander.<br> The word stings my ears. I hate being called by that title around my husband, even though he’s not awake to hear it.</p><p>It wasn’t always like this. But one day, the Flowers attacked our world and everything changed. Humanity is yet to find a key to victory; if anything, we fade a little more each time the sun rises on a new day. We’ve lost so many now: soldiers, prisoners, and yes, even commanders. The Flowers have taken them all. But the lack of people in leadership positions is our most pressing concern, so the people in charge attempted to solve it with a most novel solution:</p><p>They promoted the prisoners.</p><p>Prisoners like me.</p><p>The job of commander is to manage and control the rest of the prisoners. So when news of my own promotion came, I knew instantly that I would have to send my own husband off into the jaws of death. I couldn’t bear to share that with him, so I attempted to keep it a secret and live my life just as I always had—until the day he broke into the base and first stole confidential information.</p><p>We have rules for people who do such things. The punishment is very swift—and very final. But instead of putting him to death, I used privileges of command to keep him alive. I ordered the classified information deleted from his memories, and we returned to our normal lives. I thought I could somehow keep this up—that I could keep lying to everyone about what I was now. And I might have done it, except that my husband stole classified information again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And<br>again.</p><p>The irony is almost too much to bear: The reason he risked death to find some path to victory against the Flowers was because he wanted to protect<br>me.<br> But now, once again, it is my turn to protect him.</p><p>“Prepare for memory deletion.” I say to the officer. When she doesn’t move, I slowly turn my head to look at her. “That is a direct order.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, ma’am, but I cannot comply.”</p><p>Her quiet voice rattles in my ears. “What did you say?”</p><p>“Your husband should have been eliminated after his first transgression, but you used your authority to delete his memories and protect him. I’ve stood by as you did so again and again, but I can abide it no longer.”</p><p>She goes on to tell me that my actions are not as secret as I thought—other commanders are aware of what I have been doing, and they are displeased to say the least. If it does not stop, they will deem me unfit for command and dispose of me in the way all useless prisoners are dealt with.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for this,” I whisper. “I didn’t ask for any of it.”</p><p>And it’s true. I didn’t. I didn’t care for the power of command, or the honor, or the ceremonial trappings. The only thing I cared about was protecting the man I love.</p><p>“You have to stop this,” says the officer. “We have plans in motions, great plans that may finally turn the tide of this war and give you the revenge you seek. Would you really throw all of that away?”</p><p>She takes my hand and places it gently atop the machine. “If you turn this off, his vitals will cease to function. He’ll just… go to sleep. Quickly. Peacefully. But we’re running out of time, Commander, and we need you to make a decision.”</p><p>Her quiet voice is a faint echo in the empty room.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Change (Your) Love<br>[<br>]</p><p>The leisurely beeping that disturbs the quiet of the living room tells me the water is boiling. I get up from my chair and head to the kitchen, where I take out an assortment of snacks and prepare my tea.</p><p>Treatment like this was nigh unthinkable when I was a low-ranking soldier—or to be more blunt, a prisoner with a slightly more palatable title. But now I own a first-class apartment with a guest room—don’t know when I’ll be using that—and a constant supply of luxuries like sweets and tea.</p><p>Yes, my life certainly became enriched when I took on the position of a superior officer. But every day I wake up and ask myself what the point is to having such wealth. What even is the point?</p><p>I glanced over at the framed photograph in the center of the living room, the one showing a smiling image of my husband. He was my rock. My light. The person I loved more than anything.</p><p>And the person I killed.</p><p>Pressured by command, I made the decision to turn off my husband’s life support, abandoning what was most precious to me for the benefit of the base. As a result, my subordinates found renewed confidence in me, and my superiors praised my loyalty. But this brings me right back around to the same question I always ask: What’s the point? What is the goddamn point?</p><p>I briefly considered following my husband into the afterlife, but couldn’t do it. The shrewd watch of my commanders played a part in that decision, but ultimately, I couldn’t abandon my plan to end the Flowers once and for all.</p><p>Blowing steam across my mug, I press a few buttons on a small screen on the kitchen counter and pull up footage from a surveillance camera. Children’s voices come through, as well as the shrill bark of an overseer.</p><p>“Get in line, all of you!”</p><p>“Kay!”</p><p>There are countless prisoners exhausted by this never-ending war with the Flowers—and our recent rise in deserters is proof. But I’ve come up with a plan to give even the lowest soldier a reason to fight. Want to hear it? It’s a doozy.</p><p>See, I proposed we implant prisoners with memories of having children, then supply them with<br>actual<br> children to protect. I figured I’d face an uphill battle—or be laughed out of the room entirely—but to my shock, command not only approved the plan, they supplied the children that I needed to make it work. The little moppets now live in a care center in the base, giving the prisoners who are their “parents” a reason to keep fighting in the outside world.</p><p>The irony just<br>kills<br> me.</p><p>My own son was killed by the Flowers, is the thing—and the animosity born from that memory is what kept me alive all this time. The pain of the loss is a set of teeth on my heart as fresh as the day it happened, so the fact I’m using that same pain to help my former companions rush headlong into death is…</p><p>Well it’s monstrous.</p><p>Monstrous.</p><p>But now that I’ve chosen this path, there’s no turning back. I have to destroy the Flowers and have my revenge, because—</p><p>“I’m hooome! What’s my snack?”</p><p>A small figure rushes into the living room, and I shake myself free from my reverie as I turn to him. “You have something to do before snack time, yes?”</p><p>His face lights up as he rushes to the most prominent place in the living room: the memorial for my husband. The boy takes the photograph and holds it reverently in both of his tiny hands.</p><p>“I’m home, Dad!”</p><p>God, his eyes remind me<br>so<br> much of him…</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Change (His) Life<br>[<br>]</p><p>In my position as a senior officer, I’ve led countless projects to completion—not just the one that keeps soldiers from deserting. We’ve also mapped Flower dens around the planet, performed research into their ecology, and developed a host of new weapons. Though we’ve yet to exterminate the enemy, humanity has stepped back from the brink, and is now in the process of putting itself together again.</p><p>“Sorry we took so long, Mom.”</p><p>I turn to find my son walking into the officer’s lounge. He’s grown over the years, and is now more a man than the little boy I remembered.</p><p>“Thank you for taking the time to be here,” I say.</p><p>A woman steps out from behind my son, her wide eyes boring deep into my own.</p><p>“Uh, so, Mom? This is my girlfriend. I think I…mentioned her?”</p><p>His bashful introduction causes me to chuckle.</p><p>“Hello, ma’am,” she says. “My name is ———, and I work in the research division.”</p><p>The introduction is sweet, but unnecessary; I already know everything there is to know about her. Her name, age, job, time of birth—every moment of her life is at my fingertips. Yet I manage to put on an expression of ignorance and listen to the rest of her introduction.</p><p>“I’m pleased to have met you today,” I say when she’s done. Our chat is short, but pleasant enough, and I’m happy to see how tactfully she handles her time in the spotlight. But then, at the moment when my son is<br>supposed<br> to ease us out of the awkward silence that follows introductions, he blurts out:</p><p>“You two are kind of similar.”</p><p>“Similar?” asks his girlfriend. “You mean me and your mother?”</p><p>“Yeah. Like, I dunno. The vibes you give off.”</p><p>My mouth twists wryly at that. “Saying your girlfriend reminds you of your mother is the worst possible thing you could say, Son. If she never speaks to you again, I’ll fully support her decision.”</p><p>An awkward expression crosses my son’s face, which causes his girlfriend to burst out laughing. The tension eased at last, they give brief farewells and leave the lounge. As I watch them go, a small sigh rises in my heart. A moment later, my commander arrives and places a hot drink before me.</p><p>“Thank you,” I murmur quietly. The tea is just warm enough not to burn. She knows exactly what I like—no surprise, seeing as we’ve been mostly inseparable ever since I rose up to the position of senior officer. Perhaps that’s why she feels comfortable enough to look me in the eye and say:</p><p>“How does it feel to have your husband introduce his girlfriend to you?”</p><p>Ah, she’s always like this. She seems cold and emotionless most of the time, but in truth, she finds nothing more delightful than pushing people’s buttons.</p><p>“He is my<br>son<br> now.”</p><p>Here’s the thing: Once I learned that management possessed the technology to create clones, I used my husband’s stored genetic data to make one, then took him out of the incubator while he was still a baby. This was only done to protect him; if he were to mature there and have my husband’s old memories implanted, he’d only make the same mistake of accessing top-secret data all over again.</p><p>“And what about<br>her<br>? Does she meet expectations?”</p><p>“Not in the slightest.”</p><p>“Why not? She has a stellar reputation, and seems extremely well-tempered.”</p><p>“It’s not a question of character. Her performance is simply too average.”</p><p>This is true. The girl has shown no aptitude for science, and seems content to remain a lowly, anonymous researcher. She’s nothing like me, which means she is no proper match for<br>him<br>.</p><p>I lean back and close my eyes. Bringing up an image of her smiling face, I mentally scrawl a red X across it.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Changeling<br>[<br>]</p><p>Something rocks me, stirring me from sleep. When I open my eyes, I’m greeted by a bright, false sun and the familiar sight of my commander’s face.</p><p>“He’s crying. Should you attend to him?”</p><p>She jerks her chin toward a small crib, where I hear a baby’s disgruntled mumbling.</p><p>“Oh, yes. Thank you. Goodness, my hearing has gotten worse as I’ve grown older; I used to leap out of bed at the slightest sound when my son was a baby!”</p><p>I lift the baby into my arms and look into his eyes. “You were sleeping so soundly, little one. What do you need? A diaper change? Milk?”</p><p>As I rock the little guy in my arms to calm him down, a smile cracks across my commander’s face. It isn’t a warm, fond smile, but a cold and pitying one.</p><p>“He looks so much like you.”</p><p>“You think so?” I reply quietly, pretending not to hear the thorns in her speech.</p><p>“But I suppose he would. The father is your husb…Apologies. Your<br>son<br>. And the mother is your clone too.”</p><p>She’s correct. Around the time I created my husband’s clone, I made a dozen clones of myself. I altered some so they didn’t look exactly like me, then removed them from the incubators and gave them to prisoners who could serve as suitable parents.</p><p>“I’m surprised it went so well. Was every girl your son dated your clone?”</p><p>All my clones had been raised in varying environments, which means they show their uniqueness in different ways. Some are excellent workers with brilliant talent. Some are average. Some dropouts.</p><p>“His mother is quiet and seems average at a glance, but she has an analytical mind.”</p><p>Those who are quiet and tend to have subdued emotions are often more colorful with those they’re comfortable with.</p><p>“She’s family-oriented,” my commander says, her tone as flat as if she’s reading from a document. “Your son’s wife is almost exactly like you, from her skill set to her personality—and to a rather shocking degree.”</p><p>I’d spent decades carefully putting this project into motion just for this moment. I sent my clones to my son so they would meet, made sure they dated, then encouraged them to have children.</p><p>“Do you think me odd?”</p><p>I ask suddenly.</p><p>My commander nods. “I do. However, I don’t think it’s a bad thing. This is the happiest I’ve ever seen you.”</p><p>My son has been taken from me. My husband is lost. But now, at long last, I finally have it all back.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="063y"><a href="#063y" class="headerlink" title="063y"></a>063y</h1><h1 id="Character-Story"><a href="#Character-Story" class="headerlink" title="Character Story"></a>Character Story</h1><h2 id="Story-1"><a href="#Story-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><p>The<br> in a terrible mood… It’s because I forgot her birthday, which, yeah, was a mistake. But does she need to be<br> angry? She’s not being reasonable—and I’m going to tell her so!</p><p>Uh oh. The moment I open my mouth, she launches into a rant about all of her woes: I don’t understand women. I’m crude. I’m insensitive. She starts unloading all sorts of stuff on me. Blah, blah, blah. Well, I’m sure as hell not going to just lie back and take all that!</p><p>“You know, this is what I hate about you!” I snarl.</p><p>“You’re always bringing up these stupid unrelated issues!”</p><p>The moment the words leave my mouth, I know I’ve gone too far: one look at her face is all I need to realize that. She points to the door—and I know what<br> means. And while part of me is annoyed as hell at all of this… I decide to get out while the getting’s good.</p><h2 id="Story-2"><a href="#Story-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><p>I escape to the mess hall. My friends come up to me and ask what’s the matter—guess I look a little pale. But when I tell them how I just had a blow-up with the wife, their concern dissolves into peals of laughter. After they have their fun, they tell me I’m the one at fault. Each one has a different strategy I can use to make amends. As they talk, I realize they’re pretty good pals, all in all.</p><p>I decide to put their plan into motion. I return to the room and pick my wife up off her feet. She seems perplexed, but intrigued—which is good. I then start spinning her around the room in a dance, showing off my strength as well as my moves. But of course, I take it too far. By the time I realize it, her face has progressed from confusion to downright fury. So before I can wreck it more, I dash out of the room.</p><h2 id="Story-3"><a href="#Story-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><p>As I think about what to do, the unit commander appears. Word of our martial squabble has spread throughout the base. He warns me it will be a hindrance to our operations. Since he seems to care, I tell him what happened and ask for his advice. He chuckles a little. He then tells me he doesn’t have an ideas—and doesn’t care enough to think of any. But then he gives me a piece of “paper”—something people apparently used long, long ago in order to make amends. I don’t know what’s he’s thinking, but he’s not the kind of man to act without purpose. I decide his words must have<br> meaning. Apparently “paper” is a relic of the past used for writing. That’s when it comes to me:</p><p>Since I usually say too much. I’ll write a “letter” to my wife instead.</p><h2 id="Story-4"><a href="#Story-4" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><p>But I’m not sure what usually goes into a letter. Maybe I should start with thanks for everything she does for me every day? No, wait. An apology is probably better. I write letter after letter as I think of my wife. I write, then erase. Write, then erase.</p><p>Write, then erase. After ten or so attempts, the letter is finally complete. I go home and hand it to my wife, whose eyes go wide. This could just be because a letter is so unfamiliar, but more likely it’s because I’m genuinely apologizing. Once she reads the letter, she smiles and looks at me. Then she wraps me up in a hug… It would seem all is forgiven. My messy writing on the crumpled paper was simple: “I will protect and love you with all of my life. This I swear…” No matter what the future may hold.</p><h1 id="Dark-Memories"><a href="#Dark-Memories" class="headerlink" title="Dark Memories"></a>Dark Memories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-1"><a href="#Story-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 1<br>[<br>]</p><p>Test Record #1104</p><p>“Morning, sleepyhead. You getting up today?”</p><p>The man gently places his hand on his<br>wife’s<br> cheek as he speaks; her skin is cool to the touch.</p><p>Her temperature must drop while she sleeps<br>, he thinks. The woman does not so much as stir.</p><p>The only sound in the room is her deep, steady breathing. It is the only way he knows she still lives.</p><p>She has been asleep for nearly two weeks.</p><p>Ten days ago, they fought Flowers in the city ruins. It was a relentless battle, and many did not see it through to come out intact on the other side. His wife’s head was injured during the skirmish, and though the wound is healing nicely, she remains unconscious. The doctor said it was an after-effect of receiving a strong blow to the brain. He also warned the man she might never regain herself. He knows he should be happy she still lives. Nonetheless, he finds himself praying:</p><p>“Please wake up, honey.<br>Please.<br>“</p><p>The man had already lost his son to the Flowers. And now they threatened to steal his wife as well.</p><p>His body shivers in fear at the prospect, the anxiety boring a hole in his heart. The Flowers were taking everything from him.<br>Everything.<br> Hate swirls inside him as he unconsciously clenches his hands into fists. If only he could eradicate the Flowers…</p><p>If only he had the strength to kill them…</p><p>All right, enough of that. She’s going to wake up<br>. The man draws himself up straight, patching the hole in his heart through sheer force of will. Soon, a voice comes over the PA announcing mealtime. Even this dreary announcement, played at the same time every day, serves to take his mind from his troubles. For the first time ever, he finds the managed routines and strict rules of his lifestyle are granting him a sense of security and peace.</p><p>“I’m off to eat, honey,” he whispers.</p><p>“Be back soon.”</p><p>The man makes his way to the feeding hall. It is a simple space fitted with sterile terminals where people receive meals after scanning their IDs, as well as rows of small tables where they can eat. Right now, it is filled with prisoners who live in the man’s block. They line up in neat rows, receive the same food, plop down in assigned seats, and eat silently. The prisoners are treated like animals; it is an unnerving sight. But tools for war must be properly managed. The man looks at the empty seat beside him where his wife would typically sit. The food seems even more bland than usual this day.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of their commander rings out.</p><p>“Eyes on, people!” Tension ripples through the prisoners; an appearance from the commander typically foreshadows a problem.</p><p>“We are currently recruiting testers for new equipment. Anyone who wishes to take part can apply at the terminal in their room. That is all.”</p><p>The message delivered, he spins on a heel and leaves. The prisoners breathe a sigh of relief. The R&amp;D Department was constantly researching weapons and other gear that might be of use against the Flowers. They managed every aspect of the prisoners’ equipment, right down to what they wore in their daily lives. Their clothes heightened the wearer’s resistances and strength, but also allowed the commander control of their bodies and minds. Despite their ill feelings toward their garb, they all agreed the clothes had saved their lives on multiple occasions. For the man, however, the fact he is no better than a slave is something he has made peace with—for he will shoulder any burden and bear any pain to have his revenge. He will do whatever is necessary.</p><p>New equipment, eh? Interesting…</p><p>With more powerful weapons and equipment, they could inflict more damage on the Flowers and return from battle with fewer casualties. And maybe even end the war altogether. The man knows many people will apply to test the new equipment, because they all share this same goal. Plus, better equipment means a better chance of survival. The man thinks it over. Though he wishes to stay at his wife’s side, he knows he won’t actually be able to<br>do<br> anything for her. So when he returns to his room, he turns on his terminal and applies to test the new equipment.</p><h2 id="Story-2-1"><a href="#Story-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">                </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 2<br>[<br>]</p><p>Several days later, the man finds himself walking toward the R&amp;D training room. When he arrives, five prisoners are already there. These are the applicants who were chosen. There does not seem to be a particular type: he sees all kinds, from muscle-bound men to slender, wiry women. Once they are gathered, the commander begins to speak:</p><p>“Put your gear on and prepare to spar.”</p><p>The commander brings out six sets of bizarre clothing. They are called enhancement suits, and each one upgrades its wearer in different ways.</p><p>The man’s suit is called a “power model.”</p><p>It is designed to heighten the wearer’s physical strength. The outfit is completely black, and has a solemn, imposing air. It is made from a thick, heavy material that seems designed to function as a flexible suit of armor. He puts it on and closes the seals, noting with grim satisfaction how it encloses his entire body. The remaining five suits for the other prisoners consist of three combat-oriented models—speed, defense, and magic—and two support models: scout and medic. Today, they will be testing the combat suits.</p><p>His suit ready, the man walks to the middle of the room. Opposite him is a man in a speed suit. He can’t be more than twenty years old—little more than a kid. His suit is bright yellow, and appears only lightly armored.<br>Speed, eh? I wonder how fast we’re talkin’ here.<br> The two combatants face each other, muscles tense. After a few moments, a buzzer sounds.</p><p>“I’m coming for you, old man!” screams the kid.</p><p>The moment the words leave his mouth, he closes the distance between them in a blur. Before the man even knows what is happening, the kid punches him square in the face. He stumbles across the room before coming to a stop against the back wall.</p><p>“Oh, it ain’t naptime yet, pops!”</p><p>The kid races across the room before the man can even regain his feet. He begins dancing around him, always in his blind spot, pummeling him with a series of rapid blows and kicks. But the man feels no pain. The impact is intense, but lacks the power to penetrate his armor. The kid quickly seems to grasp this as well, and redoubles his attacks in an effort to pummel his foe into some kind of submission. His arms move too fast to be seen. His legs are streaks of yellow light.</p><p>“Give up already, you dog!” the kid taunts. With each strike the kid makes, he tosses in a barb of the tongue. The man can’t tell if his opponent is trying to goad him into sloppiness or is just always like this. Regardless, the kid clearly has the mindset of a warrior. The man places his back against the wall and raises his guard. Though each strike by itself does little damage, he knows the kid’s furious onslaught will eventually wear him down. The man looks for chances to strike back, but the kid’s speed shows no sign of slowing. Perhaps the speed suit also raises his stamina. Regardless, the power model is heavy, and unsuited to prolonged fights.<br>Time for a new plan…</p><p>“Was that you hitting me just now, kid? I thought a fly landed on me.”</p><p>“The hell did you say!?”</p><p>Taking the bait, the young man launches a roundhouse kick. His foot makes contact with the man’s side, sending a shockwave through his entire body…. But it also leaves an opening. Before the kid can recover, the man rears back and drives a fist into his gut. The young man stops moving. He stands in place, wobbling back and forth like a dying top, then slumps to the ground.</p><p>“N-nice shot, buddy…” says the kid as he fades into unconsciousness.</p><p>“But next time, I…won’t lose…”</p><p>“Heh. You fought well, kid.”</p><p>The man chuckles at his opponent’s unceasing confidence, even when staring down defeat.</p><p>His clouded heart feels a bit lighter.</p><p>The prisoners—including the kid—spend the next few days in their suits, pushing them to their very limits. Once this is done, they are ready to test them for true.</p><h2 id="Story-3-1"><a href="#Story-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 3<br>[<br>]</p><p>Urban Residential District: Block One The prisoners stand in a line amidst abandoned buildings. Each one is clad in a different suit. Their mission is to eliminate all Flowers in the area. Though technically a capability test of the suits, it is still a genuine battle. If the test goes well, the enhancement suits would be officially rolled out as new equipment, and hopefully increase the survival rates of all prisoners. The six are determined to make the mission a success. The scout activates her sensors and scans the area. Ten Flowers are detected in Block Three. Flowers typically live in easily spotted clusters. However, there are also stealth types that do not show up on scans. They will have to keep their guards up at all times. The six slowly and carefully pick their way through the ruins.</p><p>Urban Residential District: Block Three The party receives visual confirmation of ten Flowers straight ahead. They are relieved to hear the scout’s information was accurate, and proceed to the next phase of the plan. The magic unit initiates the attack. She fires a heat ray from a massive gun, transforming a nearby Flower to ash. This model of suit is vulnerable while firing, but a surprise attack solves that problem.</p><p>“Go, kid!” yells the man.</p><p>“Do your thing!”</p><p>The kid leaps into a cluster of Flowers and begins raining blows down upon them. The man follows close behind, swinging a massive greatsword that mows down everything in its path.</p><p>The battle is over in an instant. The power of the suits is overwhelming. They will turn the tide of the war. But this overwhelming victory—and the hope it brings—makes them sloppy, and they drop their guard.</p><p>“Look out!” cries the scout.</p><p>“Something’s co—“</p><p>A Flower emerges from the ground under the scout’s feet. She is thrown to the side, where she lands with her neck at an impossible angle. Death is instantaneous.</p><p>“Everyone, behind me!” yells the defense unit.</p><p>He raises a shield as the others form up in his wake. More Flowers rip through the ground beneath them. The magic unit is torn in two, causing chunks of flesh and bone to rain down around them.<br>Don’t lose heart now<br>, thinks the man as he grips his sword. Over a dozen Flowers now loom around them—and a moment later, they unleash hell. The defense unit adjusts his position to take the brunt of the attack, while the medic does her best to keep him upright. Meanwhile, the speed and power units make their way through the chaos, cutting down one Flower before moving on to the next. It is a solid battle plan—at least at first. But while the medic can heal wounds, she is powerless against the pain that accompanies a broken bone or a dislocated joint. Slowly but surely, pain begins to overwhelm the defense unit. Finally, it becomes too much to bear. He turns to flee the battlefield, and is immediately set upon and torn apart by a pair of Flowers. Six of the creatures now remain, and the man in his power suit steps into place at the fore. Each time a Flower strikes at him, he responds with a vicious attack of his own.</p><p>I won’t die here. Not now. Not like this.</p><p>I won’t leave my wife all alone!</p><p>This thought is enough to carry him through the fight. The man hears a terrible sound—a cry of fear and pain and utter, complete rage. He does not even realize he is the one making it.</p><p>Time passes. Time stands still. Eventually the man emerges from his bloodlust and sees the kid resting on his knees.</p><p>“W-we did it…” whispers the kid.</p><p>“We actually did it.”</p><p>Only then does the man notice the shredded remains of Flowers all around them. There might still be more lurking underground. If so, he does not have the energy to fight. Suddenly, he hears a familiar announcement:</p><p>“Enhancement suit battle test complete.”</p><p>“Commencing phase three of the experiment.”</p><p>As though triggered by the voice, pain courses through his head. Suddenly, a voice rings out, blocking all other thought.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>PROTECT YOUR FAMILY.</p><p>KILL THE ENEMY.</p><p>At the last line, the man loses consciousness.</p><h2 id="Story-4-1"><a href="#Story-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Operation: Black Lily Part 4<br>[<br>]</p><p>When the man’s eyes next flutter open, he finds himself lying on the floor. He struggles to his feet as the fog begins to lift from his mind… And he beholds a grisly sight. The floor is a lake of blood. In the center, hunks of flesh and a broken staff.<br>That staff… It’s the medic’s.<br> The man examines the chunks and finally finds what remains of the medic’s face. Her suit has been forcefully pried open and her skin peeled from her very bones. There’s not even enough left for a proper burial. The man feels nausea building inside him and turns away. But this only reveals a new horror: The kid—or what remains of him. He has been impaled on a massive greatsword. His arms have been plucked from the body and discarded; his face is little more than a ruined crater. It appears the corpse was pummeled into submission long past the point where the man who existed inside was dead.</p><p>No… No, this can’t be…</p><p>A horrible feeling crawls up his spine. Cold sweat runs down his face.</p><p>That sword… It’s mine.</p><p>“You killed him,” says a familiar voice.</p><p>The man whirls around to find the commander.</p><p>“I…killed him?”</p><p>His mind rejects this fact, as does his heart. But he cannot deny his bloody hands. Or his black suit—which is now a vivid red.</p><p>I did this… Oh god, I did this!</p><p>“Calm yourself. You are not to blame here.”</p><p>The commander proceeds to tell him everything.</p><p>It had all been an experiment. Command had set up the Flowers’ surprise attack—</p><p>and once it was over, they deprived the prisoners of consciousness and had them fight to the death. The commander had planned everything. After revealing this, he begins to regale the man with tales of all the data they gained from the experiment, his glee barely contained. But the man cannot hear him. His thoughts are a whirling vortex of rage.</p><p>“It appears to be somewhat dependent on the user’s mental state and personality,” continues the commander.</p><p>“But overall, the power suit was shown to provide the best balance of offense and defense.”</p><p>“We will begin mass-manufacturing it at once.”</p><p>The man’s rage compresses, finding a target in the commander.</p><p>“So my friends died for a goddamn<br>test<br>?” he growls.</p><p>“No progress is without sacrifice,” says the commander.</p><p>His tone is flat, as if the subject bores him. Enraged, the man rears back and launches a fist directly at the commander’s face. But his arm stops before it connects, his body refusing to allow it.</p><p>For all his power, he is still a prisoner.</p><p>“DAMN YOU TO HELL!” he wails.</p><p>The commander stares at the man impassively.</p><p>“I could dispose of you here and now, you know? It actually might be the smart thing to do, considering all that you’ve learned.”</p><p>An image of the man’s wife leaps into his mind.<br>I can’t die yet.<br> The man furrows his brow and slowly lowers his fist.</p><p>“Good. What happened here today will be our little secret.”</p><p>“We expect great things from your tenacity, prisoner.”</p><p>“No sacrifice is too great if it means victory over the Flowers.”</p><p>This said, the commander collects some bits of suits and departs. Silence fills the void.</p><p>I can’t die yet. I can’t die yet. I can’t die yet.</p><p>The man repeats these four words over and over.<br> I have to live for her. And the more of us who wear these suits, the more of us who will survive. He’s right. This is a<br> good<br>thing<br>. The man had killed them all—Flower and friend alike. Yet he felt a sense of might at his power. A sense of guilt for his actions. And a sense of excitement at the possibilities. All of these things eat away at him.<br>I am strong enough to protect. I am strong enough to kill.<br> The darkness inside him swells and writhes and expands until finally it consumes what remains of his heart.</p><h1 id="Recollections-of-Dusk"><a href="#Recollections-of-Dusk" class="headerlink" title="Recollections of Dusk"></a>Recollections of Dusk</h1><h2 id="Story-1-2"><a href="#Story-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><h2 id="Story-2-2"><a href="#Story-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><h2 id="Story-3-2"><a href="#Story-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><h2 id="Story-4-2"><a href="#Story-4-2" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><h1 id="Hidden-Stories"><a href="#Hidden-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Hidden Stories"></a>Hidden Stories</h1><h2 id="Story-1-3"><a href="#Story-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 1"></a>Story 1</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 1: Escape<br>[<br>]</p><p>The alarm shrieks throughout the base, disturbing the pristine silence of the night.</p><p>“ALERT. DESERTER DETECTED. CAPTURE ALIVE IF POSSIBLE.”</p><p>I hear the commander’s voice murmuring from the comms device I stole and know they’re talking about me. But just as I peek my head around the corner to see what’s what, a searchlight grazes my cheek.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>In front of me stand massive mechanical bodies twice the size of a human. Their eyes gleam ominously in the night as they sweep the area for prey. As I look, another appears. Then another. Then another. While they amass, I creep forward as slowly as possible so as not to catch their attention.</p><p>So how did all this happen? That’s easy: because of the Flowers. The appeared out of the blue one day and stole all of our happy lives away. My wife and I, we had a son, but… God, he was so young.</p><p>I volunteered to fight the Flowers in an attempt to find some kind of revenge, but humanity still hasn’t found the key to victory. My wife’s been in low spirits lately—she’s clearly exhausted by all the fighting—and I worry I may end up losing her at this rate. So that’s why I decided to conduct my own survey of the Flowers and find a way out of this no-win scenario.</p><p>As I delved into the depths of the base, I managed to download reams of data from a computer in a classified area. It was an incredibly risky move, but it ended up being more than worth it; hidden in all that data was the location of something called the Flower Den, which is the enemy’s main base. It was the kind of intel that could change everything.</p><p>But before I could even process what I’d found, I tripped an alarm and had to make a break for it. I spent so much time hiding in the shadows as I made my way inch by agonizing inch toward the exit. And now, an eternity later, I find myself so very close to my goal.</p><p>I reach up and touch my pocket to make sure the downloaded information is still there. The moment I do, a brilliant white light washes over me.</p><p>“DESERTER LOCATED.”</p><p>The voice is cold, and it grows louder as its mechanical owner moves toward my position. I can’t let them catch me here; if they do, all of this will have been for nothing.</p><p>“DROP YOUR WEAPON. LIE ON THE GROUND.”</p><p>Squinting under the light, I put my fingers on the grip of my greatsword. “All right, big fella, no need to get your panties in a twist. I’m not going to fight back.”</p><p>I toss my weapon, which clatters to the floor. “There. I’m unarmed. We good here?”</p><p>“APPREHENDING TARGET.”</p><p>The machine moves forward, ready to subdue me, but I have a surprise in store. Before it can grab me, I slip through its legs and heave myself up and onto its back, then yank the cover off the base of its neck and jam my device into the waiting socket.</p><p>“MALWARE DETECTED. COMMENCING FORCED SHUTDOWN.”</p><p>See, my sword wasn’t my only weapon—I’d also packed a self-replicating virus just in case. As soon as the machine grinds to a halt, I pick up my sword and run as fast as my legs can carry me toward the location of the Flower Den.</p><p>I’m going to end this war.</p><p>I’m going to end it tonight.</p><p>I will never lose anyone I care about ever again.</p><h2 id="Story-2-3"><a href="#Story-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 2"></a>Story 2</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 2: Exploration<br>[<br>]</p><p>My journey to the Flower Den continues. It’s a long trek, but I just put my head down, follow the stolen map data in my device, and try to trust that I know what I’m doing.</p><p>From everything I can tell, the army actually brought the den under our control some time ago, but command didn’t send anyone in to investigate. That strikes me as strange, considering it would be the perfect time to learn how the Flowers live, so I intend to find out for myself.</p><p>As night fades and morning comes, I arrive at my destination and find corpses scattered throughout the area—most likely the soldiers who were first sent in to take the place. But aside from signs of an old battle, what catches my attention is the building that stretches into the air almost beyond where I can see. Though weathered and grungy, there’s a strangely majestic air about the place, and I try to tread lightly as I slip inside through a shattered door.</p><p>The building is dim inside, and large enough that I can’t see the ends of the rooms. The walls are sturdy, their faces lush with vines. As I make my way further in, the only light comes from small streams of morning sunshine that filter in through broken windows. The hallway is a never-ending stream of shattered glass, splintered wood, and rubble. But then…</p><p>“PLEASE. PLEASE.”</p><p>I hear a woman’s voice—barely a whisper.</p><p>“Hello?” I ask. “Is someone there?”</p><p>The only response I get from the darkness is silence. As I carefully proceed forward, the far end of the building finally comes into view.</p><p>“MERCY.”</p><p>The next voice is male. Multiple survivors, maybe? I scan my surroundings, looking for human forms, when suddenly…</p><p>“Okay, what the hell?”</p><p>Resting at the far wall are a series of tiny Flower sprouts. The faces in the juvenile petals distort in agony as they attempt to speak to me.</p><p>“SALVATION.”</p><p>Several voices speak at once. I know this is what happens to people who are consumed by Flowers—they become a part of the whole, unable to express their own will any longer.</p><p>“They aren’t human anymore,” I tell myself. “They’re not human, dammit. They’re Flowers.”</p><p>The sprouts lower their petals to reveal a series of twisted faces. The way they droop toward the ground gives the impression they’re praying.</p><p>“MOTHER. SAVE US, MOTHER.”</p><p>After a moment, I realize the things are actually praying. The subject of their reverence is a dilapidated altar upon which rests a grand portrait. It’s dirty enough I can’t tell what kind of person it’s supposed to show, but it makes my heart beat in my chest for a reason I can’t explain.</p><p>Why do I feel this way?</p><p>But no one is there to answer my question, and the only response is the continued whisper of frantic prayers.</p><h2 id="Story-3-3"><a href="#Story-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 3"></a>Story 3</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 3: Elimination<br>[<br>]</p><p>“AHH. AHH. EVERYONE IS DEAD.”</p><p>In the dingy building, the smallest Flower sniffles. A medium-sized one speaks to soothe it.</p><p>“ALL IS WELL, LITTLE ONE. THE MOTHER WILL SAVE US.”</p><p>“THE MOTHER? SHE WHO CREATED US?”</p><p>Voices of prayer fill the building anew. How eerie it sounds. How horrific. The ones who stole happiness from me and my family have no right to look for salvation.</p><p>“NO. NO. NO.”</p><p>I approach silently from behind, cutting down the young Flowers with faces. I kick their remains aside and approach the altar, staring at the dirty portrait atop it.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>I spy a book fallen behind the altar. Someone’s diary. It’s tattered, the writing faded in places, but some pages are still legible.</p><p>“A Flower…religion?”</p><p>I’d heard about such things before. People believed the Flowers would save the world, and so began to worship them. It seems I had found one of their temples.</p><p>I carefully turn the pages so as not to tear the fragile paper. For a time, those who worshipped the Flowers took in young Flowers and lived alongside them in this place. But they were all eaten in the end, leaving behind only a mass of Flowers to continue a meaningless prayer without end.</p><p>As my eyes continue to scan the diary, I spot the word “portrait.” My hurried hands come to a stop and I read, transfixed.</p><p>That portrait was apparently one of the religion’s symbols, one as revered and important as the Flowers themselves. But why did they find it so precious?</p><p>I find my answer on the final page. The people in the portrait were the ones charge of Flower research—the ones who brought those monsters into the world. Their names…</p><p>“No. I don’t believe this. It’s<br>impossible<br>.”</p><p>I walk up to the altar and wipe away as much of the dirt as possible. Faces slowly appear from beneath the grime. I’m greeted with cold, tense expressions. Though the air about her is different, she looks<br>exactly like HER<br>.</p><p>I reel, staggering to keep myself upright. As my hand comes to rest on the frame, I hear something fall.</p><p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p><p>This building is a ruin; not surprising that it’s falling apart. But as I look to the ceiling, I see something writhing in the dark.</p><p>Those are…</p><p>I first thought the ceiling was covered in vines, but I was mistaken. Instead, an infinite number of juvenile Flowers have tangled together to create a roof.</p><p>They rush me as one, crying out in voices of madness. I cut them down as I run, barely escaping with my life. But it was all worth it, for I now have evidence for the theory that Flowers are sentient. This data will be a huge boon to our research—it might even be the thread that finally leads to use eliminating them once and for all.</p><p>And yet, even knowing this, I set fire to the church, burning the Flowers and erasing the portrait from existence. The crimson flames howl in the billowing wind. They swallow the building whole, reducing everything within to ash and bone.</p><h2 id="Story-4-3"><a href="#Story-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Story 4"></a>Story 4</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Ch. 4: Erase<br>[<br>]</p><p>Once I burn the church, I set off on the long road back to the base where my wife is waiting, arriving after the sun has set.</p><p>I can’t get caught. I<br>can’t<br>. They’re still after me because I’m technically a deserter. Cautious of my surroundings, I creep back to our room.</p><p>“You’re back!”</p><p>She’s been waiting for me the entire time, and looks exhausted as she leaps from her chair.</p><p>“We need to get out of here,” I reply. She’s bewildered, but I don’t wait for her to start gathering our things. I quickly pack the photo of our son, followed by his mementos. After that, I grab some portable rations I’d pilfered on a mission once, just in case.</p><p>“Get out of here and go<br>where<br>?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Her bewilderment grows at my answer.</p><p>“You can’t just vanish, then reappear out of nowhere and say we have to leave!”</p><p>I probably would have said the same in her shoes.</p><p>“Okay. I’ll keep this short, but you have to listen.”</p><p>I tell her what I saw in the church. I tell her about the bizarre Flower buds, the altar, and the portrait. The portrait of the woman who looks exactly like my wife—the one they call “Mother.”</p><p>“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?” my wife asks quietly. “I mean, that’s just not possible.”</p><p>She’s right. She fights against the Flowers. She can’t be their mother.</p><p>“The superior officers are hiding something.”</p><p>They must have known what was in that church-turned-Flower den, yet they chose not to send a survey team. I can’t understand why; all I feel is an ominous sensation gripping my entire being.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>I zip the bag shut and hold out a hand. But then…</p><p>“He has admitted to coming across top-secret information.”</p><p>That’s all she says in return. A moment later, the door swings open and commanders fall into place behind her.</p><p>“I believe he found it sometime between the evening previous and this morning. But erase two days’ worth of memories, just in case.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The commanders do as she says and grab me.</p><p>“Wait! Why are you—!?”</p><p>Ordering around commanding officers? Trying to erase my memory?<br> Before I can ask, my mouth is gagged and I’m pinned to the floor. I realize my mistake then: It isn’t the superior officers who are hiding something.</p><p>“This is for your sake,” she whispers.</p><p>A cold rod stings to my neck as a shock courses through my body. In the instinctual fear of death, my life begins to flash before my eyes.</p><p>I see my wife’s smile.</p><p>Her tear-streaked cheeks.</p><p>Her face colored with anger.</p><p>I thought I knew everything about her, but the look on her face right now is cold and distant.</p><p>Just like the woman in the portrait.</p><p>As the darkness swallows my consciousness, I remain oblivious to her intentions—and her truth.</p><h2 id="Story-5"><a href="#Story-5" class="headerlink" title="Story 5"></a>Story 5</h2><pre><code class="hljs">              </code></pre><p>Enthralling Love<br>[<br>]</p><p>A prisoner who fights Flowers for revenge…Wow!
